<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>MALICIOUSLY ACCUSED</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let them think what they like. If I had
died I would have been a hero; because
I lived I suppose there is nothing in the
history of crime that I have not committed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Young Captain Code Schofield sprang out of the
deep, luxurious chair and began to pace up and down
before the fire. He did not cast as much as a glance
at the woman near him. His mind was elsewhere.
He had heard strange things in this talk with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, captain, you know how it is on an island
like this. The tiny thing of everyday life becomes a
subject for a day&rsquo;s discussion. That affair of six
months ago was like dropping a tombstone in a mud-puddle&ndash;&ndash;everything
is profoundly stirred, but no
one gets spattered except the one who dropped it.
In this case yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Schofield stopped in his tracks and regarded his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
hostess with a look that was mingled surprise and
uneasiness. She lay back in a <i>chaise-longue</i>, her
hands clasped behind her head, smiling up at the
young man. The great square room was dark except
for the firelight, and her yellow dress, gleaming
fitfully in it, showed the curving lissomeness of her
young body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Mallaby,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when you say clever
things like that I don&rsquo;t know what to do. I&rsquo;m not
used to it.&rdquo; He laughed as though half-ashamed of
the confession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Appreciate them,&rdquo; she directed shortly with a
fleeting glance from her great dark eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you demand all my time?&rdquo; he asked and
flushed. The well-turned compliment caught her unawares
and she admitted to herself that perhaps she
had underrated this briny youth who was again beginning
to interest her extremely.</p>
<p>But with the sally he seemed to have forgotten it
and recommenced pacing the floor, his hands in his
pockets and his brows knit. His mind had gone off
again to this other vastly important thing.</p>
<p>She noticed it with a twinge of vexation. She
vastly preferred the personal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it old Jed Martin said to you this
afternoon?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That if the opinions of old sailors were of any
account Nat Burns could get up a pretty good case
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
against you for the loss of the <i>May Schofield</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he meant his own opinion. He&rsquo;s an
old sailor now, but if he lives to be a hundred and
fifty he&rsquo;ll never be a good one. I could beat his vessel
if I was on a two-by-four with a pillow-case for
a mains&rsquo;l. I can&rsquo;t understand why he has turned
against me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t only he, it&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it!&rdquo; he burst out passionately. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
the whole island of Grande Mignon from Freekirk
Head to Southern Cross. Not a man nor woman
but has turned against me since that awful day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great God! what do they think? That I
wrecked the poor old <i>May</i> for the fun of the thing?
That I enjoyed fighting for my life in that sea and
seeing the others drown with my very eyes? Don&rsquo;t
they suppose I will carry the remembrance of that
all my life? My Heaven, Elsa, that was six months
ago and I have just begun to sleep nights without the
nightmare of it riding me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice calmed him like a touch on a restive
horse, and yet he unconsciously resented the fact that
it did. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been blind, Code, and I have
heard and seen this thing growing. It is hard for a
fisherman to lose his ship and not suffer for it afterward
at the hands of inferior sailors. I&rsquo;ve known
you all my life, Code, and I believe in you now just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
as I did that day in school you took the whipping I
should have got for passing you a note.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t heard the last of the <i>May Schofield</i>,
and you won&rsquo;t until you lay the ghost that has come
out of its grave. But whatever you do or wherever
you are, I want you to remember that I stand ready
to help you in every way I can. All this&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;she
swept her arm about the richly furnished room&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;is
worthless to me now that Jim is gone, unless I
can do some good for those I like. Please, Code,
will you feel free to call on me if you need help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The flush that had receded returned with a flood
of color that made his face beneath its fair hair appear
very dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, Elsa,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s awfully
handsome of you, but I hope things won&rsquo;t go so far
as that. I can never forget what you have said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsa Mallaby had always been like that to him.
Even when she married &ldquo;Hard-Luck&rdquo; Jim Mallaby
she had always seemed to regard Code Schofield as
the one man in Freekirk Head. But Jim, being too
busy with his strange affairs, had not noticed.</p>
<p>Jim it was who, after twenty years of horrible
poverty and ill-luck, had caught the largest halibut
ever taken off the Banks and made thousands of dollars
exhibiting it alive. And it was this same Jim
who, for the remaining ten years of his life, turned
to gold everything he touched.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span></div>
<p>Mallaby House was his real monument, for here,
on the great green hill that overlooked the harbor,
he had erected a mansion that made his name famous
up and down the Bay of Fundy. And here, seven
years ago, he had brought Elsa Fuller as his bride&ndash;&ndash;Elsa
Fuller who was the belle of Freekirk Head,
and had been to Boston to boarding-school.</p>
<p>It was to Mallaby House that Code Schofield had
come to dinner this night. He had not wanted to
come and had only agreed when she bribed him with
a promise of something very important she might
reveal.</p>
<p>The revelation was hardly a pleasure. Nothing
had been a pleasure to him since that day six months
ago when his old schooner, dismasted and leaking
in a gale, had foundered near the Wolves, two sharp-toothed
islands near Grande Mignon. Four islanders
had been lost that day, and he alone had lived
through the surf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else did old Jed Martin say, Elsa?&rdquo; he
asked suddenly.</p>
<p>She knitted her brows and stared into the fire.
Why would he always go back to that?</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said that the <i>May Schofield</i> should have
been able to live out that gale easily if she had been
handled right, old as she was. She <i>was</i> pretty old,
wasn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifty years. She was twenty when dad got
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
her&ndash;&ndash;he sailed her twenty-eight and I had her for
two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got a good deal of insurance out of her,
didn&rsquo;t you, Code?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten thousand dollars&ndash;&ndash;her full value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you bought the <i>Charming Lass</i> with that,
didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;that and two thousand that dad had
saved. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Jed Martin said something about that, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Schofield&rsquo;s face paled slightly and his mouth closed
tightly, exhibiting the salience of his jaw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it, eh? Thinks I ran her under for the
insurance&ndash;&ndash;the old barnacle. Is that around the
island, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it must be, or I shouldn&rsquo;t have heard
about it. You didn&rsquo;t, of course, did you, Code?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly expected you would ask that, Elsa.
Why, I loved that old schooner like I love&ndash;&ndash;well,
my mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you, Code; you don&rsquo;t need to ask that.
I just wanted to hear you deny it. But you know
there were some queer things about her sinking just
then, when she was supposed to be in good condition.
Nat Burns&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! So he is in it, too. What does he say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says that her insurance policy was just about
to run out. Is that so?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a tone of defiance in his answer that
caused her to look up at him quickly. His blue eyes
were narrowed and his face hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it wasn&rsquo;t such a hard gale, was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;ve weathered lots worse with the <i>May.</i>
I can&rsquo;t explain why she sank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Michael Burns, who was aboard of her,
was the insurance inspector, wasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; The reply was more a groan than a
spoken word. He laughed harshly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see Nat Burns&rsquo;s hand in all this,&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t I think of it before? He will dog me
till I die because his father lost his life aboard my
schooner. Oh, I had no idea it was as bad as this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sank down into the chair again and stared
gloomily into the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I came to-night,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t know all these things. How long has this
talk been going round?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not long, Code.&rdquo; Her voice was all sympathy.
&ldquo;It is simply the result of brooding among our people
who have so little in their lives. I&rsquo;m sorry.
What will you do? Go away somewhere else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her quickly&ndash;&ndash;scorn written upon
his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go away,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;and admit my own
guilt? Well, hardly. I&rsquo;ll stay here and see this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
thing through if I have to do it in the face of all of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Splendid, Code!&rdquo; she cried, clapping her hands.
&ldquo;Just what I knew you would say. And, remember,
I will help you all I can and whenever you need me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her gratefully and she thrilled with
triumph. At last there was something more in his
glance than the purely impersonal; he had awakened
at last, she thought, to what she might mean to him.</p>
<p>There followed one of those pauses that often
occur when two people are thinking intensely on different
subjects. For perhaps five minutes the cheerful
fire crackled on uninterrupted. Then, suddenly
recollecting himself, Code sprang to his feet and held
out his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half-past ten,&rdquo; he said, glancing at the mahogany
chime-clock on the mantelpiece. &ldquo;I must really
go. It has been kind of you to have me up to-night
and tell me all these&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inner secrets of your own life that you never
suspected before?&rdquo; she laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. You have done me a service like the
good old friend you always were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took his hand, and he noticed that hers was a
trifle cold. They started toward the hallway.</p>
<p>From the broad veranda of Mallaby House the
view extended a dozen miles to sea. Beneath the
hill on which the mansion stood the village of Freekirk
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
Head nestled against the green. Now the dim,
yellow lights of its many lamps glowed in the darkness
and edged the crescent of stony beach where
washed the cold waters of Flag&rsquo;s Cove.</p>
<p>To the left at one tip of the crescent the flash of
Swallowtail Light glowed and died like the fire in
a gigantic cigarette. To the right, at the other,
could be seen the faint lamps of Castalia, three miles
away.</p>
<p>For a minute they stood drinking in the superb
beauty of it all. Then Elsa left him with a conventional
word, and Schofield heard the great front
door close softly behind her.</p>
<p>Silently he descended the steps, when suddenly
from the town below came the hideous, raucous shriek
of a steam-whistle.</p>
<p>He stood for a minute, astonished, for the whistle
was that of the steamer <i>Grande Mignon</i>, that daily
plied between the island and the mainland. Now the
vessel lay at her dock and Code, as well as all the
island, knew that her wild signaling at such an hour
foreboded some dire calamity.</p>
<p>Swiftly buttoning his coat, he started on a run
down the winding, rocky path that led from Mallaby
House. He cast one more glance toward the roofs
of the village before he plunged among the pine and
tamarack, and in that instant caught a red glow from
the general direction of the fish wharfs.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>THE RED PERIL</h3>
</div>
<p>Five minutes of plunging and slipping brought
him down to the main road that gleamed a
dim gray in the blackness. A quarter of a
mile east lay the wharfs, the general store, and some
of the best dwellings in Freekirk Head.</p>
<p>Ahead of him in the road he could see lanterns
bobbing, and the illuminated legs of the men who
carried them running. Behind he heard the muffled
pound of boots in thick dust, and the hoarse panting
of others racing toward the scene of the trouble.
The frantic screeching of the steamer&rsquo;s whistle (that
was not yet silent) had done its work well. Freekirk
Head was up in arms.</p>
<p>Instinctively and naturally Code Schofield ran, just
as he had run from his father&rsquo;s house since he was ten
years old. His long, easy stride carried him quickly
over the ground, and he passed two or three of those
ahead with lanterns. They shouted at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo; panted one.
&ldquo;Know anything about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but it might be the wharfs,&rdquo; he replied, without
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
stopping. He veered out to the edge of the
road so as to avoid any more queries. He looked
with suspicion now on all these men.</p>
<p>Who of them, he wondered, was not, in his heart,
convicting him of those things Elsa Mallaby had
mentioned? His straightforward nature revolted
against the hypocrisy in men that bade them treat
him as they had done all his life, and yet think of
him only as a criminal.</p>
<p>Suddenly the dull red that had glowed dimly
against the sky burst into rosy bloom. A great
tongue of fire leaped up and licked the heavens, while
floating down the brisk breeze came the distant mingling
of men&rsquo;s shouts. As he passed a white wooden
gate he heard a woman on the porch crying, and a
child&rsquo;s voice in impatient question.</p>
<p>Then for the first time he lost sight of his own
distress and thought of the misery of his whole people.
It was August, and the Indians should soon be
coming from the mainland to spear porpoises.</p>
<p>The dulce-pickers on the back of the island reported
a good yield from the rocks at low tide, but
outside of these few there was wretchedness from
Anthony&rsquo;s Nose to Southern Cross.</p>
<p>The fish had failed.</p>
<p>A hundred years and more had the Grande Mignon
fishermen gone out with net and handline and
trawl; and for that length of time the millions in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
sea had fed, clothed, and housed the thousand on the
island. When prices had been good there were even
luxuries, and history tells of men who, in one haul
from a weir, have made their twenty-five thousand
dollars in an hour.</p>
<p>This was all gone now. The fish had failed.</p>
<p>Day after day since early spring the men had put
to sea in their sloops and motor-dories, trawling and
hand-lining from twenty miles out in the Atlantic to
four and a half fathoms off Dutch Edge. The result
was the same. The fish were poor and few. Even
at Bulkhead Rip, where the sixty-pounders played
among the racing tides, there was scarcely a bite.</p>
<p>A fisherman lives on luck, so for a month there was
no remark upon the suddenly changed condition.
But after that, as the days passed and not a full dory
raced up to Bill Boughton&rsquo;s fish stand, muttered whispers
and old tales went up and down the island.</p>
<p>It was recalled that the fish left a certain Norwegian
coast once for a period of fifty years, and that
the whole occupation of the people of that coast
was changed. Was that to be the fate of Grande
Mignon? If so, what could they do? Extensive
farming on the rocky island was impossible, and not
one ship had ever been built there for the trade.
Where would things end?</p>
<p>So it had gone until now, in the middle of August,
the people of Freekirk Head, Seal Cove, and Great
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
Harbor, the main villages along the front or Atlantic
side of the island, were face to face with the question
of actual life or death.</p>
<p>So far the season&rsquo;s catch was barely up to that of
a good month in normal times; credit was low, and
salting and drying were almost useless, for the people
ate most of their own catch. Things were at a standstill.</p>
<p>And now the fire on top of all!</p>
<p>Captain Code Schofield thought of all these things
as he ran along the King&rsquo;s Road toward the fire.
Now he was almost upon it, and could see that the
fish stand and wharf of the two wealthiest men in the
village were burning furiously. The roar of the
flames came to him.</p>
<p>A hundred yards back from the water stood Bill
Boughton&rsquo;s general store, and next it, in a row, dwellings;
typical white fishermen&rsquo;s cottages with green
blinds and a flower-filled dory in the front yard.</p>
<p>The King&rsquo;s Road divided at Bill Boughton&rsquo;s store,
the branch leading down to the wharfs, while the
main road went on to Swallowtail Light. Schofield
plunged down the branch into the full glare of the
fire, where a crowd of men had already gathered.</p>
<p>As good luck would have it there was not a vessel
tied up to the stand, the whole fleet being made fast
to its moorings in the bay. Code&rsquo;s first duty when
he started running had been to make sure that his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
<i>Laughing Lass</i> was riding safely at her anchorage.</p>
<p>The burning wharfs faced south. The brisk
breeze was southeast and bore a promise of possible
rain. The steamer <i>Grande Mignon</i>, after giving
the first warning, had steamed away from her perilous
dockage to a point half a mile nearer the entrance to
the bay, and now lay there shrieking until the frowning
cliffs and abrupt hills echoed with the hideous
noise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d it happen?&rdquo; asked Schofield of the first
man he met.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunno exactly. Cal&rsquo;late some tanks in the oilroom
caught first. Can&rsquo;t do much with them wharfs,
I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s in charge of things here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The squire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Schofield hurried away in search of Squire Hardy,
head man of the village, and local justice of the
peace. He found him working like a Trojan, his
white whiskers ruffled into a circle about his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lend us a hand here, Code,&rdquo; yelled the squire,
who with three other men was attempting to get a
great circular horse-trough under a huge pump with
a handle long enough for three men to lay hold of.
Schofield fell to with a will and helped move the
trough into place. The squire set the three men to
the task of filling it and then went to Code.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any chance to save those wharfs, d&rsquo;ye think?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No, squire. Better leave them and the fish-houses
and work on Boughton&rsquo;s store and the cottages.
They&rsquo;re right in the path of the wind. It&rsquo;ll
be tough on Nailor and Thomas to lose their stand
and houses, but you know what will happen if the fire
gets into the dwellings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so all along&ndash;&ndash;curse me if I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
yelled the judge, and then, turning toward a crowd of
men who were looking apprehensively here and
there, he shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All hands with the buckets now, lively!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly the basement doors of Boughton&rsquo;s store
were thrown open and a huge, black-bearded man
with a great voice appeared there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buckets this way!&rdquo; he bellowed, in a tone that
rose clearly above the roar and crackle of the fire.
As the men reached him he handed out the implements
from great stacks at his feet&ndash;&ndash;rubber buckets,
wooden buckets, tin and iron buckets, new, old, rusty
and galvanized. It was Pete Ellinwood, the fire
marshal of the village and custodian of the apparatus.</p>
<p>Because in the hundred or more years of its existence
there has never been water pressure in Grande
Mignon, the fighting of a fire there with primitive
means has become an exact and beautiful science.</p>
<p>A few bold spirits had disputed the wisdom of
Squire Hardy&rsquo;s orders to let the wharf and fish-house
burn, and had attempted to give them a dousing. In
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
less than five minutes they had retreated, singed and
hairless, due to a sudden explosion of a drum of oil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Play on Bill Boughton&rsquo;s store!&rdquo; came the order.</p>
<p>Already an iron ladder reached to the eaves of the
building. Two men galloped up its length, dragging
behind them another ladder with a pair of huge
hooks at the end.</p>
<p>Clinging like monkeys, they worked this up over
their heads and up the shingles until the hooks caught
squarely across the ridge-pole of the house. Then,
on hands and feet, they trotted up this and sat astride
the ridge-pole. One of these was Code Schofield.</p>
<p>Other men now swarmed up the ladders, until
there was one on every rung from the ground to the
top of the house.</p>
<p>Below, a line of men extended from the foot of
the ladder to the great circular horse-trough. Another
line extended from the opposite side of the
store also to the horse-trough, where three men
worked the great pump.</p>
<p>Back twenty yards, along the King&rsquo;s Road, a white-faced
row of women and children stood, ready to
rush home and move their furniture into the fields.</p>
<p>Code, looking down, made out his mother and returned
her friendly wave. Their house was across
the road not a hundred feet away.</p>
<p>With a muffled roar another drum on the pier exploded.
A great wave of molten fire shot out in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
breeze, and the shingles on Bill Boughton&rsquo;s store,
parched with the drought of a month, burst into quick
flame.</p>
<p>The squire ran back to the water-trough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dip!&rdquo; he yelled. Big Pete Ellinwood, with the
piles of buckets beside him, seized one and twitched
it full.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pass!&rdquo; screamed the squire as it came up dripping.
Ellinwood&rsquo;s great arm swung forward to
meet the arm of the man a yard away. The bucket
changed hands and went forward without losing a
drop.</p>
<p>Up it went swiftly from one to another, to the
eaves, to the two men at the top.</p>
<p>Now the fire sent branches out from the burning
wharf along the low frames where some of the season&rsquo;s
miserable catch was drying in the open air
after salting. The fish curled and blackened in the
fierce heat.</p>
<p>Only two men were not in the bucket brigade.
They were Nailor and Thomas, who stood watching
the destruction of their whole property. They knew
the squire had done well in saving the village rather
than their own buildings. It was the tacit understanding
in Freekirk Head that a few should lose
rather than the many.</p>
<p>Code Schofield, from his perch on the Boughton
roof-tree, looked down again to where he had last
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
seen his mother. Once more he distinguished the
tall figure with its white face looking anxiously up
at him, and he waved his hand reassuringly. Then
his eye was caught by two other figures that lurked
in the first shadows farther up the King&rsquo;s Road. A
moment later he made sure of their identity.</p>
<p>They were Nellie Tanner and Nat Burns.</p>
<p>For years there had been a dislike between the
Burnses and the Schofields. Old Jasper Schofield,
Code&rsquo;s father, and Michael Burns had become enemies
over the same girl a quarter of a century before,
and the breach had never been healed. Old Captain
Jasper had won, but he had never forgotten,
and Michael had never forgiven.</p>
<p>Quite unconsciously the feud had been passed on
to the children of both (for Michael had married
within a few years), and from school-days Code and
Nat had been the leaders of rival gangs.</p>
<p>When they became young men they matched their
season&rsquo;s catches and raced their father&rsquo;s schooners.
They were the two natural leaders of the Freekirk
Head young bloods, but they were never on the same
side of an argument.</p>
<p>Schofield wondered why Nat Burns was not at the
fire, as usual attempting to make himself leader of
the battle without doing much of the work, and now
the reason was apparent. He preferred to pursue
his courting under the eyes of the village rather than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
to obey the unwritten law of service. And he was
with Nellie Tanner!</p>
<p>Unlike most youths, there had never been a time
in Code&rsquo;s life when he had passed the favor of his
affections around. Since the time they were both
five Nellie Tanner had supplied in full all the feminine
requirements he had ever desired. And she
did at this moment. But Nat Burns had seen a great
deal of her in the last three months, he remembered,
taking advantage of Code&rsquo;s desperate search for
fish.</p>
<p>Once in this train his thoughts bore him on and
on. Memories, speculations, and desires crowded his
mind, and he forgot that beneath him the roof of
Boughton&rsquo;s store was burning more and more briskly.</p>
<p>Suddenly the man beside him on the ridge-pole
shook his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Code!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that burnin&rsquo;
over there? I didn&rsquo;t know the fire had gone across
the street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Schofield looked up quickly and followed the
direction of the other&rsquo;s arm that pointed through
the trees to the opposite side of King&rsquo;s Road and a
little to westward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; he cried excitedly; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s my own
place, and my mother is all alone down there.
Quick! Send somebody up here! I&rsquo;m going!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>THE TEST</h3>
</div>
<p>The man behind him climbed to the ridge-pole
and Code began the descent, necessarily
slow and careful because the ladders
were loaded with men passing buckets. When he
reached the ground he started for home on the run.</p>
<p>Opposite Boughton&rsquo;s general store was another
shop that made a specialty of fishermen&rsquo;s &ldquo;oilers,&rdquo;
boots, and overalls. Two houses to the westward
of that was the old Schofield place, a low, white
house surrounded by a rickety fence and covered
with ivy.</p>
<p>Once he reached the middle of the road Code saw
that he had been mistaken in the location of the fire,
for his mother&rsquo;s place was intact. The flame was
coming, however, from the house next but one&ndash;&ndash;Bijonah
Tanner&rsquo;s place.</p>
<p>A crowd was gathering in the yard that was overgrown
with dusty wire-grass, and the squire was pushing
his way through to take charge. Code knew
that only two days before Captain Bijonah and his
wife had sailed in the <i>Rosan</i> to St. John&rsquo;s for lumber,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
leaving Nellie alone in charge of the three small
Tanners. He wondered where they all were now.</p>
<p>He found his mother on the edge of the crowd
that was helping to save the furniture, and learned
that Nellie and young Burns had already arrived and
were doing what they could.</p>
<p>From the first it was apparent that the place was
doomed, for although there were plenty of men eager
to form a bucket brigade, the supply of water was
limited, and most of the buckets were at the larger
fire.</p>
<p>But the squire was working wonders, and enlisted
Code to help him.</p>
<p>In fifteen minutes the whole roof and attic were
ablaze, and the men turned their attention to wetting
down the near walls of the houses on each side.
All the valuables and most of the simple furniture
had been saved.</p>
<p>At the earliest moment Schofield escaped from the
squire and sought out Nellie. He found her, hysterical,
surrounded by a group of women, and
hovered over by Nat Burns. With each hand she
held a child close to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bige! Where is little Bige?&rdquo; she was crying
as Code came up. &ldquo;Tom and Mary are here, but
I&rsquo;ve lost Bige. Oh, Nat! Where is Bige?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless me if I know,&rdquo; stammered Burns weakly.
&ldquo;Last I saw of him he was under that cherry-tree
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
where you told him to stay until you got the others.
It wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t more&rsquo;n five minutes ago I seen him there.
He must be around somewheres. I&rsquo;ll look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without another word he hurried off in a frantic
search, looking to left and right, behind every bush,
and among the crowd, bellowing the boy&rsquo;s name at
the top of his voice.</p>
<p>Code walked up to the frantic girl and went
straight to the point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Nellie!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Where do you cal&rsquo;late
little Bige might be? I hear you&rsquo;ve lost him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have, Code. I stood him under that
cherry-tree and told him not to move. When I got
back he was gone. He was seven, and just old
enough to run around by himself and investigate
things. Oh, I&rsquo;m so afraid he&rsquo;s gone&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Code&rsquo;s sharp, masterful tone put a
sudden end to her sobbing. &ldquo;Was there anything
in the house he valued much?&rdquo; Suddenly she drew
in her breath sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;his mechanical train. He
asked me if I had got it and I said I had. He must
have gone over to the furniture and found it hadn&rsquo;t
been brought down. Oh, Code, Code&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Nellie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Nat Burns&rsquo;s hard voice as he elbowed
roughly past Code and bent solicitously over the
girl. He had heard her last words and the pleading
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
in them, and his brow was dark with question
and anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you find him, Nat?&rdquo; queried Nellie in an
agony of suspense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t know where the little beggar can
be,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; The girl screamed and
fainted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter here?&rdquo; shouted Burns.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boy went back into the house for his toy engine
and hasn&rsquo;t come out again,&rdquo; said Code, facing
the other and regarding him with a level eye.</p>
<p>There was a dramatic pause. After Nat&rsquo;s proprietary
interest in Nellie and her affairs it was distinctly
his place to make the next move. Everybody
felt it, and Code, subconsciously realizing this,
said nothing.</p>
<p>It required another moment for the situation to
become clear to Burns. Then, when he realized
what alternatives he faced, he gradually grew pale
beneath his deep tan and looked defiantly from one
to another of the group about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rot!&rdquo; he cried suddenly. &ldquo;The boy can&rsquo;t have
gone back. It wasn&rsquo;t five minutes ago I saw him
under the cherry-tree. I haven&rsquo;t looked in this direction.
Wait! I&rsquo;ll be back in a minute!&rdquo; And
again he was off in his frantic search, his voice rising
above the roar of the fire.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></div>
<p>Code waited no longer.</p>
<p>Snatching up a blanket from the ground, he raced
toward the burning house.</p>
<p>The lower floor was still almost intact, but the
upper floor and the roof were practically consumed.
The danger lay not in entering the house, but in
remaining in it, for although the roof had fallen in,
yet the second floor had not burned through and was
in momentary danger of collapse.</p>
<p>The spectators did not know what was in Code
Schofield&rsquo;s mind until he had burst into the danger
zone. Then, with the blanket wound about his arm
and shielding his face he plunged toward the open
doorway. It was as though he stood suddenly before
the open door of a vast furnace.</p>
<p>The blast of heat seemed an impenetrable force,
and he struggled against it with all his strength.</p>
<p>One more look, a mighty effort, and he was in
the temporary shelter of the doorway. He drew a
long breath and plunged forward.</p>
<p>He knew the plan of the Tanner house as he knew
his own, and he remembered that in the rear was a
room where the children played. The hall ran
straight back to the door of this room; but there
was no egress from the rear except through the
kitchen, which adjoined the play-room.</p>
<p>The heat that beat down upon his head made him
dizzy, and he could not see for the smoke that filled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
the hall. Instinctively he went down on his hands
and knees, discarding the blanket, and crawled toward
the rear.</p>
<p>He had scarcely reached the closed door of the
play-room when, with a thunderous roar, the ceilings
at the front of the house fell in, cutting off any escape
in that quarter. He knew that at any moment the
rest of the ceilings would collapse.</p>
<p>Half-strangled with the increasing smoke, he
staggered to his feet and lunged against the door,
forcing it open. The dim light from the one square-paned
window showed a small form huddled on the
floor, the mouth open, and a tiny locomotive gripped
in one hand.</p>
<p>A rush of smoke and flame followed the violent
opening of the door, and Code felt himself growing
giddy. A swift glance behind showed a wall of
fire where the hall had once been, and for the first
time he realized the seriousness of the task he had
taken upon himself. But there was no fear.
Rather there came a sense of gladness that a fighter
feels when the battle has at last come to close grips.</p>
<p>He swept the small form of Bige up into his arms
and leaped to the window that was built low in the
wall and without weights. To raise it and manipulate
the catch was out of the question. With all his
strength he swung his foot against the pane squarely
in the middle. Panes and frame splintered outward,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
leaving the casement intact except for a few jagged
edges of glass.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, as he dropped the boy to the
ground outside, there came a blast of fire on the back
draft created by the opening. Singed and strangling,
with a last desperate effort he threw himself
outward and fell on his shoulders beside little
Bige.</p>
<p>Men who had heard the crash of glass when the
window went out rushed forward and dragged man
and boy to safety.</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour later, his head and neck bandaged
with sweet-oil, Code made his way weakly to
where Nellie sat among her belongings cradling in
her arms the boy whom the doctor had just brought
back to consciousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s all right, is he?&rdquo; asked Schofield.</p>
<p>She smiled up at him through her tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the doctor says it was just too much smoke.
Oh, Code, how can I thank you for this? And you
are hurt! Is it bad? Can&rsquo;t I do anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She struggled to her feet, solicitude written on her
face, for the moment even forgetting little Bige,
who had begun to howl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Schofield, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t do anything. It
isn&rsquo;t much. I&rsquo;m only glad I succeeded. Don&rsquo;t
think anything about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father and mother will never forget this, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
I&rsquo;m sure will do what they can to make it right with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her as though she had struck him.
Never in his life had she used that tone. Before
the mute query of his eyes she turned her head
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean&ndash;&ndash;by that?&rdquo; he faltered,
hardly knowing what he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, Code, only&ndash;&ndash;only&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She could
not finish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has happened, Nellie?&rdquo; he began, and
then halted, his gaze riveted upon her hand. A
single diamond glittered from the dirt and grime
that soiled her finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That?&rdquo; he gasped, stunned by a feeling of
misery and helplessness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nat and I are engaged,&rdquo; she said in a low
voice without answering his question. &ldquo;Just since
last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was nothing more to be said. The banal
wishes for happiness would not rise to his lips. He
looked at her intently for a moment, saw her eyes
again drop, and walked away. He was suddenly
tired and wanted to go home and rest. The reaction
of his nervous and physical strain had set in.</p>
<p>The hundred yards to his own gateway was a
triumphal procession, but he scarcely realized it.
Somehow he answered the acclamations that were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
heaped upon him. He smiled, but he did not know
how.</p>
<p>At the gate some one was waiting for him. At
first he thought it was his mother, but he suddenly saw
that it was Elsa Mallaby. He told himself that she
must have come down to the village to watch the fire,
and wondered why she was in that particular place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Code,&rdquo; she cried, her face flushed with glad
pride, &ldquo;you were splendid! That was the bravest
thing I ever heard of in my life. I knew you would
do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled mechanically, thanked her, and passed
on while she gazed after him, hurt and struck silent
by the cold misery in his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; she said to herself slowly, &ldquo;whether
something besides what I told him has happened to
him to-night?&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>REFUGEES</h3>
</div>
<p>It was almost one o&rsquo;clock in the morning when
Code went into the parlor of his mother&rsquo;s cottage
and sank down upon the ancient plush
sofa. His eyes ached, and the back of his head and
neck, where the fire had singed him, were throbbing
painfully.</p>
<p>There was apparently no one at home.</p>
<p>Even little Josie, the orphan that helped his
mother, seemed to have been drawn out into the road
by the excitement of the night, and the house, except
for a single lamp burning on the table, was in darkness.</p>
<p>He thought of going up-stairs to bed, but remembered
that his mother was not in, and decided he
would rest a little while and then go out and find her.
Suddenly it seemed very luxurious and grateful to
be able to stretch at full length after so much labor,
and within a few minutes this sense of luxury had
become a pleasant oblivion.</p>
<p>Voices and a bright light woke him up. Dazed
and alarmed, he struggled to a sitting posture, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
a gently firm hand pushed him down again and he
heard his mother&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lay down again, Code,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You must
be pretty well beat out with all you&rsquo;ve done to-night.
We&rsquo;ve just got some friends for the night. Poor
boy, let me see your burns!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Schofield, who had guided schooners for years
through the gales and shoals of the Bay of Fundy
without a qualm, became red and ashamed at his
mother&rsquo;s babying. Rubbing his sleepy eyes, he sat
up again determinedly and made an effort to greet
the company who, he knew, had come into the room
with his mother.</p>
<p>Across the room, near the old melodeon, sat Nellie
Tanner, holding little Bige and smiling wanly at
him. The other two children leaned against her,
asleep on either side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get up, Code,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
earned your rest more than any man in Freekirk
Head to-night. I&rsquo;m afraid, though, we&rsquo;re going to
make more trouble for you. Ma Schofield wouldn&rsquo;t
let me go anywhere else but here till the <i>Rosan</i> gets
back from St. John&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hate to think of their coming! They&rsquo;ll
sail around Flag Point and look for the kiddies waving
in front of the house. And they won&rsquo;t even see
any house; but, thanks to you, Code, they&rsquo;ll see the
kiddies.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></div>
<p>He knew by the tense, strained tone of her voice
that she was very near the breaking-point, and his
whole being yearned to comfort her and try to make
her happy.</p>
<p>Cursing himself for a lazy dolt, he sprang up
and walked over toward her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, you just let me handle this, Nellie,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll soon have Tommie and Mary and
Bige all curled up on that sofa like three kittens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a sigh of ineffable relief she resigned the
dead weight in her weary arms to him, and he, stepping
softly, and holding him gently as a woman,
soon had the boy more comfortable than he had been
for hours. Mary and Tommie followed, and
then Nellie, free of her responsibility at last,
bent forward, put her elbows on her knees, and
wept.</p>
<p>Code, racked and embarrassed, looked around for
his mother, but that mainstay was nowhere in sight.
He thought of whistling, so as to appear unconscious
of her tears, but concluded that would be merely
rude. To take up a paper or book and read it in
the face of a woman&rsquo;s weeping appeared hideous, although
for the first time in many months, he felt
irresistibly drawn to the ancient and dusty volumes
in the glass-doored bookcase.</p>
<p>He compromised by turning his back on the affecting
sight, thrusting his hands in his pockets, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
studying the remarkably straight line formed by the
abrupt junction of the wall and the ceiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mind if I cry, C&ndash;&ndash;Code?&rdquo; sobbed the
girl, apparently realizing their position for the first
time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! Go right ahead!&rdquo; he cried as heartily as
though some one had asked for a match. He was
intensely happy that the matter was settled between
them. Now the harder she cried the more he liked
it, for they understood one another. So she cried
and he walked softly about, his hands in his pockets
and his lips puckered for the whistle that he did not
dare permit himself.</p>
<p>Ma Schofield interrupted this near-domestic scene
by her arrival, carrying a tray, on which were several
glasses covered with a film of frost and out of which
appeared little green forests. Code ceased to think
about whistling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ma Schofield, what have you done?&rdquo; cried
Nellie, her tears for the moment forgetting to
flow as her widening eyes took in the delights
of the frosted glasses and piles of cake behind
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done?&rdquo; queried ma. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t done anything
but what my conscience tells me ought to be
done. If yours cal&rsquo;lates to disturb you some you can
go right on up to your room, lamb, for you must
be dead with lugging them children around.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></div>
<p>Nellie&rsquo;s tears disappeared not to return. She
shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, ma,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;my conscience is just like
them children&ndash;&ndash;sleeping so hard it would take Gabriel&rsquo;s
trumpet to wake &rsquo;em up. It&rsquo;s more tired than
I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said ma, with finality; &ldquo;we will now
proceed to refresh ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was two o&rsquo;clock before they separated for the
remainder of the night.</p>
<p>Code&rsquo;s room, with its big mahogany double bed,
was given over to Nellie and the children while he
gladly resigned himself to the humpy plush sofa.</p>
<p>By this time they had received news from half a
dozen neighbors that Bill Boughton&rsquo;s general store
had been only half destroyed and that the contents
had all been saved. The wharfs and fish-houses
were at last burning and property on the leeward
side of the flames was declared to be safe.</p>
<p>A general exodus began along the King&rsquo;s Road.</p>
<p>Men who had galloped up from Great Harbor,
with an ax in one hand and a bucket in the other,
mounted their horses and rode away. Others from
Hayward&rsquo;s Cove and Castalia, who had driven in
buggies and buckboards, collected their families and
departed. The King&rsquo;s Road was the scene of a
long procession, as though the people of Freekirk
Head were evacuating the town.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></div>
<p>A detachment of men under Squire Hardy&rsquo;s orders
remained about the danger zone ready to check any
further advance of the flames or to rouse the town to
further resistance should this become necessary. But
for the most part the people of the village returned
to their homes.</p>
<p>Wide-awake and nervous, Schofield lay open-eyed
upon the couch while unbidden thoughts raced
through his brain.</p>
<p>The very fact of his sleeping on the plush couch
was enough to bring to his mind the memory of one
whom he had irretrievably lost on this memorable
night. Was she not at this moment under his own
roof, miserable and nearly destitute? He knew that,
as long as he might live, his humble room up-stairs
would never be the same again.</p>
<p>It had been made a place sweet and full of wonder
by the very fact that she was in it. Never
again, he knew, could he enter it without its being
faintly fragrant of her who, all his life, he had considered
the divinest created thing on earth. By her
presence she had sanctified it and made of it a shrine
for his meditative and wakeful hours.</p>
<p>Ever since they had gone to school together, hand
in hand, the names of Nellie Tanner and Code Schofield
had been linked in the mouths of Grande Mignon
busybodies. Living all their lives two doors
away, they had grown up in that careless intimacy of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
constant association that is unconscious of its own
power until such intimacy is removed.</p>
<p>To-night the shock had come.</p>
<p>It was not that Code had taken for granted that
Nellie would marry him. Never in his life had he
told her that he loved her. It is not the habit of
men who rove the seas to keep those they love constantly
supplied with literature or confectionery, or
to waste too many words in the language of devotion.</p>
<p>He admitted frankly to himself that he had always
hoped to marry her when he had acquired the quarter
interest in Bill Boughton&rsquo;s fishstand that had
been promised him, but he had not told her so, nor
did he know that she would accept him. The idea
had been one to be thought of only at times of quietness
and confidence in his future such as come to
every man.</p>
<p>But he had not reckoned on Nat Burns. He had
not realized quite to what an extent Burns had made
progress. He recalled, now that it was brought
forcibly home to him, that Nat had been constantly
at the Tanners&rsquo; for the last four or five months.
But Code had thought nothing of this, for Nat had
paid similar court at times to others of the girls of
Freekirk Head. He was, in fact, considered the
village beau.</p>
<p>And Nellie herself had told him nothing. There
had been a modest shyness about her in their relations
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
that had kept him at an exasperating and piquant
distance.</p>
<p>Well, everything was over now, he told himself.
He could take his defeat since Nellie did not care
for him.</p>
<p>Then he suddenly recalled Burns&rsquo;s actions and
manner of speaking during the harrowing moments
of the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if Nat really loves her?&rdquo; he asked
himself. &ldquo;And if not, why did he become engaged?&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>STARTLING NEWS</h3>
</div>
<p>The home-coming of Captain Bijonah Tanner
and his wife did not provide the thrill
looked for by the more morbid inhabitants
of Freekirk Head. In the excitement of the fire all
hands had forgotten that cable communication between
Mignon and the mainland was unbroken.</p>
<p>The operator, in the pursuance of his duty, had
sent word of the fire to Eastport, and then concocted
some cable despatches for Boston and Portland
papers that left nothing to be desired from the viewpoint
of sensationalism. In his zeal for filling space
and eking out his slender income, the operator left
nothing standing on Grande Mignon except the
eternal rocks and the lighthouse.</p>
<p>It was such an account that Bijonah Tanner fed
upon that morning in the tiny cabin of the <i>Rosan</i>,
and half an hour after he had read it he was under
way. Special mention had been made of Code
Schofield&rsquo;s rescue of little Bige, with a sentence added
that the Tanner place had been wiped out.</p>
<p>With their minds filled with desperate scenes of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
cataclysm and ruin, the Tanners raced the complaining
<i>Rosan</i> around Flag Point six hours later, only to
fall upon one another and dance for joy at the sight
of the village nestling as of yore against the green
mountains and gleaming white in the descending sun.</p>
<p>An acrid smell and a smudge of smoke told of
what had really been, and a black heap of ruins where
the familiar house had stood for so long confirmed
their fears for their own property; but to see the village
content and smiling, except for a poor building
or two, was joy enough to overbalance the personal
loss.</p>
<p>So those who expected a tearful and emotional
home-coming were disappointed.</p>
<p>Code met the dory that rowed ashore after Bijonah
had made fast to his mooring in the little cove
that was the roadstead for the fishing fleet. He had
half expected to share the duty with Nat Burns since
the recent change in his relations to the Tanners, but
Burns did not put in an appearance, although it was
three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Bijonah shook hands with him, and Ma Tanner
kissed him, the latter ceremony being a baptism of
happy tears that all were safe and alive. Bijonah
cleared his voice and pulled hard at his beard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Understand you&rsquo;re quite a hero, Code,&rdquo; he ventured
bluffly, careful to conceal any emotion, but resolved
to give the occasion its due.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, rot, captain!&rdquo; said Code equally bluffly, and
the ceremony was over.</p>
<p>But not so with Ma Tanner. She wept and
laughed over the preserver of her offspring, and
called him so many exalting names that he was glad
to turn her over to Nellie and his mother at the
Schofield gate.</p>
<p>Hot and flushed with the notoriety she had given
him along the main road, he retired to the corner
shop and drank wonderful cold ginger-beer out of a
white stone jug until his temperature had returned
to normal.</p>
<p>But later he returned to the house, and found the
Tanners about to depart. The widow Sprague, near
the Odd Fellows&rsquo; Hall, who lived, as she expressed
it, &ldquo;all deserted and alone,&rdquo; had agreed to take the
family into her rambling cottage. Luke Fraser had
brought his truck-cart up alongside the rescued Tanner
belongings, and they were already half loaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you come down to the widdy&rsquo;s to-night,
Code?&rdquo; asked Bijonah. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got somethin&rsquo; to
tell ye that ought to int&rsquo;rest ye consid&rsquo;able.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll be there about eight,&rdquo; was the reply
as Schofield joined in loading the truck.</p>
<p>He found the captain that night smoking a pipe on
the low front porch of the Widow Sprague&rsquo;s cottage,
evidently very much at home. Bijonah motioned
him to a chair and proffered a cigar with a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
slightly self-conscious air. Inside the house, Code
could hear the sound of people moving about and the
voice of a woman singing low, as though to a child.
He told himself without question that this was Nellie
getting the kiddies to sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A feller hears queer things over in St. John&rsquo;s
sometimes,&rdquo; announced Bijonah suddenly, sucking at
his pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; this time I heard somethin&rsquo; about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me? I don&rsquo;t know three people in St. John&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I met one of the three, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where? How? Who was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bijonah Tanner coughed and shifted uneasily in
his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I was takin&rsquo; a little turn along
the water-front, just a <i>leetle</i> turn, as the wife will
tell you, when I dropped into a&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;that is&ndash;&ndash;a
rum-shop and heard three men at the table next to
mine talking about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Schofield smiled broadly in the darkness. Bijonah&rsquo;s
little turns along the water-front of St. John&rsquo;s
or any other port had been the subject for much
prayer and supplication in the hearts of many devout
persons thoroughly interested in their neighbor&rsquo;s welfare.
And of late years Ma Tanner had been making
trips with him to supply stimulus to his conscience.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What were they talking about?&rdquo; So far from
being suspicious, Code was merely idly curious of the
gossip about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My boy,&rdquo; said Tanner, suddenly grave, &ldquo;I was
the best friend your father had for forty years, and
I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to try and be as good a friend to his son.
But you mustn&rsquo;t mind what I tell ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t, captain. Go ahead,&rdquo; said Code, his
interest awakening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, them men was talkin&rsquo; about the loss of
the old <i>May Schofield</i>, and one of &rsquo;em in particular
allowed as how he didn&rsquo;t think it should have foundered
when it did. What d&rsquo;ye think of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Schofield had stiffened in his chair as though undergoing
a spasm of pain. The sentences smote him
between the eyes of his sensibilities. Had it come
to this, that his name was being bandied dishonorably
about the barrooms of St. John&rsquo;s? If so, how
and why?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I suppose you&rsquo;ve heard the talk in Grande
Mignon before this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Code, I have; and I&rsquo;ve called every man a
liar that said anything definite against you. I&rsquo;m gettin&rsquo;
old, but there ain&rsquo;t very many men here able
enough to shove that name back down my throat,
an&rsquo; I notice none of &rsquo;em tried. It&rsquo;s all idle talk,
that&rsquo;s all; an&rsquo; there ain&rsquo;t a soul that can prove a
single thing against you, even cowardice. An&rsquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
that&rsquo;s more&rsquo;n can be said o&rsquo; some men in this
village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Code was grateful, and he said so. It was something
to find a friend so stanch and loyal that suspicion
had never even found soil in his mind where
it might take root. Two such he had now: Elsa
Mallaby and Bijonah Tanner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else did those men say?&rdquo; he asked in
conclusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I remember right, an&rsquo; I was perfectly clear
at the time, this is what one said: &lsquo;Fellers,&rsquo; sez &rsquo;e
to the other two, &rsquo;e sez&ndash;&ndash;&lsquo;fellers, that young Captain
Schofield in Freekirk Head is goin&rsquo; on the rocks,
or I don&rsquo;t hear what&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; on in my office.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then they&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to sue him to recover part
of his insurance on the old schooner <i>May Schofield</i>?&rsquo;
asks the second.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If I didn&rsquo;t hear the chief say that this mornin&rsquo;
you can shoot me on sight!&rsquo; the first answers. An&rsquo;
then for a while I couldn&rsquo;t hear any more, an&rsquo; you
can bet I was watchin&rsquo; the door somethin&rsquo; awful for
fear ma would come in an&rsquo; spoil it all by draggin&rsquo;
me off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who were these men?&rdquo; asked Code.
&ldquo;Whom did they mean by the chief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just gettin&rsquo; to that. After a while, from
a little bit here an&rsquo; a little there, I made out that the
first young feller was private secretary to the president
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
of the Marine Insurance Company. That&rsquo;s the
firm that carried the old <i>May</i>, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so. They&rsquo;ve got my <i>Rosan</i>, too,
though I wish mightily now that they hadn&rsquo;t. This
feller is the private secretary to the president, an&rsquo;
the other two are clerks or something in the office.
They may have been up to something crooked, and
then again they may have just been talkin&rsquo; things
over as young fellers often do when they&rsquo;re interested
in their work. Anyway, there&rsquo;s enough in
what they said to set you thinkin&rsquo;, I cal&rsquo;late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Code slowly and grimly, &ldquo;it is. I&rsquo;ve
only known that the island was talking since last
night, and now I find St. John&rsquo;s is, too. It&rsquo;s spreading
pretty fast, it seems; and I wonder where it will
end?&rdquo; He pondered silently for a while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they sue to recover, what&rsquo;ll you do?&rdquo; ventured
Tanner hesitatingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God knows!&rdquo; answered Schofield and laughed
bitterly. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got a thing on earth but the
<i>Charming Lass</i>, an&rsquo; this year I haven&rsquo;t caught enough
fish to pay for my new mains&rsquo;l. My credit is still
good at Bill Boughton&rsquo;s, but that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the cottage&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is my mother&rsquo;s, and they could never get
that. If they sue and I lose they must take the
<i>Lass</i>, and after they&rsquo;ve subtracted the judgment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
from the sale price I suppose I&rsquo;ll get the rest&ndash;&ndash;maybe
enough to buy a second-hand sloop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but that isn&rsquo;t the worst part of it, Code.
As soon as they bring suit they will attach the
schooner, so that even if the trial doesn&rsquo;t come up
for weeks you still can&rsquo;t use her, and will have to
sit around idle or go hand-lining in your dory. And
you know what that means with winter comin&rsquo; on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; He had seen hard winters that had
tried the resources of the village to the utmost, but
he had never faced one that promised to be like the
next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what would you advise me to do, captain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; snapped Tanner. &ldquo;Get a crew and
take the <i>Lass</i> to sea. There&rsquo;s one thing sure, a
lawyer can&rsquo;t serve you with a summons or anything
else if he has to look for you on the Atlantic Ocean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Schofield smiled. The remedy called for was
heroic, truly; but was it honorable?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if they can do that, anyway?&rdquo; he
asked. &ldquo;After the <i>May</i> was lost the insurance people
settled without a complaint. Can they rake up
that matter again now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove! That reminds me. Them fellers
discussed that very thing; an&rsquo; the secretary said that
if the law had been broke at the time of the sinkin&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;I
mean, if the schooner wasn&rsquo;t fit or had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
tampered with&ndash;&ndash;that it was within the law. But,
o&rsquo; course, somebody&rsquo;s got to make the complaint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; cried Code, springing up and
throwing away the stump of his cigar; &ldquo;somebody
has got to make the complaint! Well, now, from
what I can see, somebody&rsquo;s made it. All this talk
could not have gone on in the island unless it started
from somewhere. And the question is, where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were interrupted by the sound of footsteps.
In the darkness the figure of a man appeared approaching
the house. A moment later the newcomer
stepped on the low veranda, and both men
recognized him.</p>
<p>It was Nat Burns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Nellie here?&rdquo; he asked without the formality
of the usual greetings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late she is, Nat,&rdquo; replied Tanner, rising to
his feet. &ldquo;Wait a minute an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll call her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he had not reached the door before the girl
herself stepped out on the porch. She ran out
eagerly, but stopped short when she saw Code in the
darkness. Their meeting was obviously reserved.</p>
<p>In the interim Tanner walked to where Schofield
stood, silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late I can give you a pretty good idea where
all this trouble started from,&rdquo; he growled in a low
tone; but before he could go on Nellie interrupted
him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she said, coming forward with Nat,
&ldquo;I want to tell you something that we&rsquo;ve all been
too busy to discuss before this. Nat and I are engaged.
He gave me the ring night before last when
you were in St. John&rsquo;s. I hope you are pleased,
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bijonah Tanner remained silent for a moment,
plainly embarrassed by the duty before him. Between
most men who follow the sea and their daughters
there is much less intimacy than with those who
are in other walks of life. Long absences and the
feeling that a mother is responsible for her girls are
reasons for this; while in the case of boys, who begin
to putter round the parental schooner from their
earliest youth, a much closer feeling exists. Tanner
could not bridge the chasm between himself and his
daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you tell your mother?&rdquo; he asked finally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And was she satisfied?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed; she was very happy about it, and
told me to come right down and tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, if it suits her it suits me,&rdquo; was the dry conclusion.
&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll be happy. You&rsquo;ve got a
fine gal there, Nat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I have, captain,&rdquo; said Burns warmly;
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll try to make her happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; grunted Bijonah, and sank back into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
his chair. Between praising one man who saved his
youngest boy, and congratulating another who was
to marry his eldest girl, Captain Tanner&rsquo;s day had
been over full of ceremonial.</p>
<p>Face to face with the inevitable, Code Schofield
offered sincere but embarrassed congratulations; and
he was secretly glad that, when opportunity offered
for him to shake Nat Burns&rsquo;s hand, that young gentleman
was busy lighting a cigarette.</p>
<p>The lovers went inside, and Code stood dejectedly,
leaning against the railing. Tanner removed
his pipe and spat over the railing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too blamed bad!&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Code, almost unconsciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad, I say. I used to think that mebbe
Nellie would like you, Code. I&rsquo;ve counted on it
consid&rsquo;able all my life. But it&rsquo;s too late now.
Young Burns&rsquo;ll have to be one of the family from
now on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, captain,&rdquo; said Schofield with forced
cheerfulness. &ldquo;I had hoped so, too. But that&rsquo;s all
past now. By the way, who was it you thought
started all this trouble? I&rsquo;d like to know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the family,&rdquo; muttered Tanner, his
thoughts still busy. Then, recollecting Schofield&rsquo;s
question, he appeared about to speak, hesitated, and
at last said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless my soul and body if I know! No, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
wouldn&rsquo;t want to say what I thought, Code. I never
was one to run down any man behind his back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Code looked in amazement at the old man, but not
for long. A moment&rsquo;s thought concerning Tanner&rsquo;s
recently acquired relation made his suspicion doubly
sure that Nat Burns&rsquo;s name had been on Bijonah&rsquo;s
tongue.</p>
<p>He immediately dropped the subject and after a
little while took his departure.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>THE ISLAND DECIDES</h3>
</div>
<p>In Freekirk Head, next morning, painted signs
nailed to telegraph-poles at intervals along the
King&rsquo;s Road as far as Castalia read:</p>
<p class='center'>MASS-MEETING TO-NIGHT<br />
ODD FELLOWS HALL<br />
8 O&rsquo;CLOCK&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ALL COME</p>
<p>Who had issued this pronunciamento, what it signified,
and what was the reason for a town meeting
nobody knew; and as the men trudged down to their
dories drawn up on the stony beach near the burned
wharfs, discussion was intense.</p>
<p>Finally the fact became known that a half-dozen
of the wealthiest and best-educated men in the village,
including Squire Hardy and the Rev. Adelbert
Bysshe, rector of the Church of England chapel, had
held a secret conclave the night before at the squire&rsquo;s
house.</p>
<p>It was believed that the signs were the result, and
intimated in certain obscure quarters that Pete Ellinwood,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
who had always claimed literary aspirations,
had printed them.</p>
<p>Odd Fellows&rsquo; Hall was the biggest and most pretentious
building in Freekirk Head. It was of two
stories height, and on its gray-painted front bore the
three great gilt links of the society. To one side of
it stood a wreck of a former factory, and behind it
was the tiny village &ldquo;lockup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It marked the spot where the highway turned
south at right angles on its wild journey southwest, a
journey that ended in a leap into space from the three hundred
foot cliffs of gull-haunted, perpendicular
Southern Head.</p>
<p>The interior of the hall was in its gala attire.
Two rows of huge oil-lamps extended down the middle
from back to front; others were in brackets down
the side walls, and three more above the low rostrum
at the far end. The chairs were in place, the windows
open, and the two young fishermen who acted
as janitors of the hall stood at the rear, greeting
those that arrived with familiar jocularity.</p>
<p>Into the hall, meant to accommodate two hundred,
three hundred people were packed. The men in
their rusty black, the women in their simple white
or flowered dresses, the children brushed and pig-tailed,
had all brought their Sunday manners and
serious, attentive faces.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></div>
<p>On the low platform presently appeared the Rev.
Adelbert Bysshe and Squire Hardy. The rector was
a young man with a thin, ascetic face. His mouth
was pursed into a small line, and he wore large,
round spectacles to aid his faded blue eyes. His
clerical garb could not conceal the hesitating awkwardness
of his manner, and the embarrassment his
hands and feet caused him seemed to be his special
cross in life.</p>
<p>When the audience had become quiet he rose and
took his stand before them, lowering his head and
peering over his glasses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we have gathered here to-night
to discuss the welfare of Grande Mignon Island
and the village of Freekirk Head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A look of startled uncertainty swept over the simple,
weather-beaten faces in front of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know that I am not exaggerating,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;when I say that we are face to face with the
gravest problem that has ever confronted us. It
has pleased God in His infinite Providence so to
direct the finny tribes that the denizens of the deep
have altered the location of their usual fishing-grounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Day after day you men have gone forth with
nets and lines like the fishers of old; day after day,
also like some of the fishers of old, you have returned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
empty-handed. The salting-bins are not
filled, the drying-frames are bare, the shipments to
St. John&rsquo;s have practically ceased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not need to tell you that this spells destitution.
This island depends on its fish, and, since
cod and hake and pollock have left us, we must cast
about for other means of support.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This meeting, then, after due deliberation last
night and earnest supplication of the Almighty for
guidance, has been called to determine what course
we shall pursue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bysshe, warm now and perspiring freely, retired
to his seat and mopped his face. Across the
audience, which had listened intently, there swept
a murmur of low speech.</p>
<p>It is not given to most fisherfolk to know any
more than the bare comforts of life. Theirs is an
existence of ceaseless toiling, ceaseless danger, and
very poor reward. Hardship is their daily lot, and
it requires a great incentive to bring them to a full
stop in consideration of their future.</p>
<p>Here, then, in Freekirk Head were three hundred
fishermen with their backs against the wall&ndash;&ndash;mutely
brave because it is bred in the bone&ndash;&ndash;quietly
preparing for a final stand against their hereditary
enemies, hunger and poverty.</p>
<p>The low murmur of awestruck conversation suddenly
stopped, for Squire Hardy, with his fringe of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
white whiskers violently mussed, had risen to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bysshe has just about got the lobster in the
pot,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;but I want to say one thing more.
Things were bad enough up to a week ago, but since
the fire they have been a great deal worse. Mr.
Nailor and Mr. Thomas, who owned the fish stand
that burned, have been cleaned out. They gave employment
to about twenty of you men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those men are now without any work at all because
the owners of the other fish stands have all the
trawlers and dorymen they need. Even if they
didn&rsquo;t have, there are hardly enough fish to feed all
hands on the island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than that&ndash;&ndash;and now I hope you won&rsquo;t
mind what I am going to say, for we&rsquo;ve all been in
the same boat one time or another&ndash;&ndash;Mr. Boughton
can&rsquo;t be our last hope much longer. You and I and
all of us have got long-standing credit at his store
for supplies we paid for later from our fishing.
The fire of the other night cost Mr. Boughton a lot,
and, as most of his money is represented in outstanding
credit, he cannot advance any more goods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Boughton is not here himself, for he told
me he would never say that word to people he has
always trusted and lived with all his life. But I
am saying it for him because I think I ought to, and
you can see for yourselves how fair it is.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, that&rsquo;s about all I&rsquo;ve got to add to what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
Mr. Bysshe has said to you. Yes, there&rsquo;s one thing
more. Great Harbor and Seal Cove below us here
are as bad if not worse off than we are. We cannot
look for help in that direction, and I will be a
lot thinner man than I am now before I ever appeal
to the government.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not paupers, and we don&rsquo;t want city newspapers
starting subscription-lists for us. So, as Mr.
Bysshe has said, the only thing for us to do is to
get our eyes out of the heavens and see what we can
do for ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The squire sat down, pulling at his whiskers and
looking apprehensively at the rector, of whose polished
periods he stood in some awe.</p>
<p>The audience was silent now. The squire had
brought home to these men and women some bald,
hard facts that they had scarcely as yet admitted
even to themselves. There was scarcely one among
them whose account with Bill Boughton was fully
satisfied, and now that this mainstay was gone the
situation took on an entirely different aspect.</p>
<p>For some minutes no one spoke. Then an old
man, bearded to the waist, got upon his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen some pretty hard times on this island,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;but none like this here. I&rsquo;ve thought it
over some, and I&rsquo;d like to make a suggestion. My
son Will is over on the back of the island pickin&rsquo;
dulce. The market fer that is good&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;s even
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
got ten cents a pound this summer. This is the
month of August and winter is consid&rsquo;able ways off.
How about all hands turnin&rsquo; to an&rsquo; pickin&rsquo; dulce?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This idea was received in courteous silence.
There were men there who had spent their summers
reaping the harvest of salty, brown kelp from the
rocks at low tide, and they knew how impractical
the scheme was. Although the island exported
yearly fifteen thousand dollars&rsquo; worth of the strange
stuff, it was plain that should all the men devote
themselves to it the return would by no means
measure up to the labor.</p>
<p>One after another, then, the fishermen got to their
feet and discussed this project. In this cause of
common existence embarrassment was forgotten
and tongues were loosed that had never before addressed
a public gathering.</p>
<p>A proposition was put forward that the islanders
should dispute the porpoise-spearing monopoly of
the Quoddy Indians that were already sailing across
the channel for their annual summer&rsquo;s sport, but this
likewise met with defeat.</p>
<p>A general exodus of men to the sardine canning-factories
in Lubec and Eastport was suggested, and
met with some favor until it was pointed out that the
small sardine herring had fallen off vastly in numbers,
and that the factories were hard put to it to
find enough work for their regular employees.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></div>
<p>Self-consciousness and restraint were forgotten in
this struggle for the common preservation, and
above the buzz of general intense discussion there
rose always the voice of some speaker with an idea
or suggestion.</p>
<p>Code Schofield had come to the meeting with Pete
Ellinwood and Jimmie Thomas, both dory mates at
different times. They sat fairly well forward, and
Code, glancing around during the proceedings, had
caught a friendly greeting from Elsa Mallaby, who,
with some of her old girlhood friends, sat farther
back.</p>
<p>The solemn occasion for and spirit of the meeting
had made a deep impression on him; but, as the
time passed and those supposedly older and wiser
delivered themselves merely of useless schemes, a
plan that had come into his mind early in the evening
began to take definite shape. As he sat there
he pondered the matter over until it seemed to him
the only really feasible idea.</p>
<p>Finally, after almost two hours of discussion with
no conclusion reached, a pause occurred, and Code,
to the amazement of his companions, got upon his
feet. As he did so he flushed, for he wondered how
many of those eyes suddenly fixed upon him were
eyes of hostility or doubt. The thought stung him
to a greater determination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be considered bold after so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
many older men have spoken,&rdquo; he said, looking at
the squire, &ldquo;but I have a suggestion to make.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead, make it,&rdquo; bellowed the squire cordially.
&ldquo;I wish more young men would give us
their ideas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thinking it over, I have come to this conclusion,&rdquo;
proceeded Schofield. &ldquo;There is only one
thing the men on this island do perfectly, and that
is fish. Therefore, it seems only common sense to
me that they ought to go on fishing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A ripple of laughter ran around the room that
was now hot and stuffy from the glare and smell of
the great oil-lamps. Code heard the laugh, and
his brows drew down into a scowl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, they cannot go on fishing here. But
there are any number of places north and east of
us where they can go on. I mean the Grand Banks
and the Cape Shore in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.
We have schooners and sloops, we have dories, and
men, and can get provisions on credit, I should think,
for such a cruise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, then, is my idea&ndash;&ndash;that the captains of
Grande Mignon fit out their vessels, hire their crews
on shares, and go out on the Banks for fish like the
Gloucester men and Frenchmen. If we do it we&rsquo;re
going against the best in the world, but I don&rsquo;t believe
there is a fisherman here who doesn&rsquo;t believe
we can hold our own.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></div>
<p>Suddenly far back in the room a woman arose.</p>
<p>She was young, and her face showed that once
it might have been beautiful. Her frame was large
and angular, and her rusty black clothes sat awkwardly
upon it. But youth and beauty and girlish
charm had gone from her long since, as it does with
those whose men battle with the sea. She was a
widow, and a little girl clung sleepily to her dress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Code Schofield,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;what about the
women? Ye ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; off to leave us fight the winter
all alone, are ye? Ye ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to sail them
winter gales on the shoals, are ye? How many of
ye do you s&rsquo;pose will come back?&rdquo; She shook off
those near her who tried to pull her down into her
seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last year they lost a hundred an&rsquo; five out o&rsquo;
Gloucester, an&rsquo; every year they make widders by the
dozen. If it was set in India&rsquo;s coral strand ye&rsquo;d
know it was a fishin&rsquo; town by its widders; an&rsquo; Freekirk
Head&rsquo;ll be just like it. I lost my man in a
gale&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; Her voice broke and she paused. &ldquo;D&rsquo;ye
want us all to be widders?</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can ye go an&rsquo; leave us? It&rsquo;s the women
the sea kills with misery, not the men. What can
we do when you&rsquo;re gone? There ain&rsquo;t any money
nor much food. If there come a fire we&rsquo;d all be
cleaned out, for what could we do? If you&rsquo;ll only
think of us a little&ndash;&ndash;us women&ndash;&ndash;mebbe you won&rsquo;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
go.&rdquo; She sank down amid a profound silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor thing!&rdquo; rumbled Pete Ellinwood. &ldquo;She
shouldn&rsquo;t have come. Al Green was her man.&rdquo;
Sobbing sounded in another quarter of the hall, and
the men looked at one another, disconcerted. Still
no one spoke. The matter hung in the balance, for
all saw instantly that could the women be provided
for this was the solution of the problem.</p>
<p>Though taken aback, Code stood to his guns and
remained on his feet.</p>
<p>Suddenly in the middle of the hall another woman
rose. Her motion was accompanied by the rustle
of silk, and instantly there was silence, for Elsa
Mallaby commanded considerable respect.</p>
<p>Code saw her with surprise as he turned. She
noted his puzzled expression and flashed him a dazzling
smile that was not lost, even in that thrilled
and excited crowd. He answered it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I consider that Captain Schofield has solved the
problem,&rdquo; she said in a clear, level tone. &ldquo;There
is no question but that the men of Grande Mignon
should fit out their ships and fish on the Banks.
There is also no question but that the objection Mrs.
Green raised makes such a thing impossible. Now,
I want to tell you something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I belong in Freekirk Head, and you have all
known me since I was little. Hard-luck Jim Mallaby
belonged in Freekirk Head and made his money
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
out of the island. Jim&rsquo;s money is mine now, and
you can rest assured that while the men are away
fishing no woman or child on Grande Mignon shall
go hungry while I am alive to hear of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some people hate me because I live in a big
house and have everything. It is only natural and
I expect it, but ever since Jim left me I have wondered
how I could do the most good with his money
here. I would like to <i>give</i> it; but if you won&rsquo;t have
that, you can borrow it on a long-time loan without
interest or security. Now I will go out and
you can talk it over freely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a companion she walked up the aisle and
to the door, but before she reached it Code Schofield
was standing on a chair, his hat in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three cheers for Mrs. Mallaby!&rdquo; he yelled,
and the very building shook with the tumultuous response.</p>
<p>It was five minutes before the squire, purple with
shouting for order, could be heard above the noise.
Then, with hand upraised, he shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All in favor of Schofield&rsquo;s plan say ay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the &ldquo;ay&rdquo; was the greatest vocal demonstration
ever given in Freekirk Head.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>A STRANGER</h3>
</div>
<p>The ensuing week was one such as the village
had never beheld. A visitor to the island
might have thought that war had been declared
and that a privateering expedition was being
fitted out.</p>
<p>On the railroad near Flag Point there was always
some vessel being scraped or painted. Supplies
brought over from St. John&rsquo;s by the steamer <i>Grande
Mignon</i> were stowed in lazarets and below. Rigging
was overhauled, canvas patched or renewed,
and bright, tawny ropes substituted for the old ones
in sheet and tackle.</p>
<p>Every low tide was a signal for great activity
among the vessels made fast alongside the wharfs,
for the rise of the water was nearly twenty feet, and
when it receded the ships stood upright on their
keels and exposed their bottoms to scraper, calking
mallet, and paint-brush.</p>
<p>In every house where father or son was expecting
soon to sail the women were busy with clothing
and general outfit. There was a run on the store
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
carrying oilskins, sea-boots, oil-lamps, stoves, and
general paraphernalia.</p>
<p>All these things were gotten on credit, for there
is no such thing as a vessel returning empty-handed
from the Banks, and Bill Boughton stood sponsor
for most of them.</p>
<p>The owners of vessels divided their time between
provisioning and overhauling their ships and the securing
of crews. One rainy afternoon, when work
had been generally suspended, a number of the men
gathered inside Bill Boughton&rsquo;s store to wait for a
let-up in the downpour, and the subject of crews was
broached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How you comin&rsquo; with your crew, Bige?&rdquo; asked
a tall, lanky man of Captain Tanner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First rate. Got a dozen men now an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s
about all the <i>Rosan</i> can take care of. At that somebody&rsquo;ll
have to sleep on a locker, I cal&rsquo;late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re doin&rsquo; well, Bige. I hear Jed Martin
can&rsquo;t round up more&rsquo;n eight, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s been as fur
south as Great Harbor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye wonder?&rdquo; put in a third. &ldquo;Jed ain&rsquo;t
never set up grub that a shark would eat. I sailed
with him once five year ago, an&rsquo; that was enough fer
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twelve men ain&rsquo;t much,&rdquo; put in Tanner.
&ldquo;Them Gloucester men sail with sixteen or eighteen
right along, and I&rsquo;ve heard o&rsquo; one feller put out of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
T-Wharf, Boston, carryin&rsquo; twenty-eight dories. Of
course, them fellers lays to fill up quick and make
short trips fer the fresh market. Ain&rsquo;t many of
them briners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s anybody&rsquo;ll carry sixteen
men out of here, is they?&rdquo; came a voice from over
in the corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; The rumble and bellow of the reply denoted
Pete Ellinwood where he sat on a cracker-box,
his six and a half feet of length sprawled halfway
from one counter to the other. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Nat
Burns&rsquo;s <i>Hettie B.</i> She&rsquo;ll carry sixteen, and so will
Code Schofield&rsquo;s <i>Laughing Lass</i>&ndash;&ndash;mebbe more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! Yes, if he can git &rsquo;em,&rdquo; sneered a voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Git &rsquo;em! O&rsquo; course he&rsquo;ll git &rsquo;em. Why not?&rdquo;
demanded Ellinwood, turning upon the other belligerently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;they do say there&rsquo;s
men in this village, and farther south, too, that
wouldn&rsquo;t sail with Code, not fer a thousand dollars
and all f&rsquo;und.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them that says it are fools,&rdquo; declared Ellinwood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; liars!&rdquo; cut in Bijonah Tanner hotly.
&ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t they sail with the lad? He can handle
a schooner as well as you, Burt, and better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yas,&rdquo; said the other contemptuously; &ldquo;nobody&rsquo;s
ever forgot the way he handled the old <i>May
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
Schofield</i>. Better not play with fire, Bige, or you&rsquo;ll
get your hands burned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pete Ellinwood got upon his feet deliberately.
He was the biggest and most powerful man in the
village, despite his forty-five years, and his &ldquo;ableness&rdquo;
in a discussion&ndash;&ndash;physical or otherwise&ndash;&ndash;was
universally respected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here you, Burt, an&rsquo; all the rest of you fellers.
I&rsquo;ve got something to say. Fer consid&rsquo;able
time now I&rsquo;ve heard dirty talk about Code and the
<i>May Schofield</i>&ndash;&ndash;dirty talk an&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; more.
Now, if any of you can prove that Code did anything
but try and save the old schooner, let&rsquo;s hear
you do it. If not, shut up! I don&rsquo;t want to hear
no more of that talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was silence for a while as all hands sought
to escape the gray, accusing eye that wandered
slowly around the circle. Then from back in the
shadow somewhere a voice said sneeringly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ax you got to grind, Pete?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A laugh went round, for it was common talk that,
since the death of Jasper Schofield, Pete had expressed
his admiration for Ma Schofield in more
than one way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got this ax to grind, Andrew,&rdquo; replied Ellinwood
calmly, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;m signed on as mate in the
<i>Charming Lass</i>, an&rsquo; I believe the boy is as straight
and as good a sailor as anybody on the island.&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
This was news to the crowd, and the men digested
it a minute in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many men ye got sailin&rsquo; with ye?&rdquo; asked
one who had not spoken before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five outside the skipper an&rsquo; me,&rdquo; was the reply,
&ldquo;an&rsquo; I cal&rsquo;late we&rsquo;ll fill her up in a day or so.
Seven men can sail her like a witch, but they won&rsquo;t
fill her hold very quick. She&rsquo;ll take fifteen hundred
quintal easy, or I judge her wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A prolonged whistle from outside interrupted the
discussion, and one man going to the door announced
that it had stopped raining. All hands got up and
prepared to go back to work. Only Bijonah Tanner
remained to buy some groceries from Boughton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steamer&rsquo;s early to-day,&rdquo; said the storekeeper,
glancing at his watch. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s bringin&rsquo; me a lot of
salt from St. John&rsquo;s, and I guess I can get it into the
shed to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having satisfied Tanner, he went out of the store
the back way and left the captain alone filling his
pipe. A short blast of the whistle told him that the
steamer was tied up, and idly he lingered to see who
had come to the island.</p>
<p>The passengers, to reach the King&rsquo;s Road, were
obliged to go past the corner of the general store,
and Bijonah stood on the low, wooden veranda,
watching them.</p>
<p>Some two dozen had gone when his eye was attracted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
by a pale, thin youth in a light-gray suit and
Panama hat. He thought nothing of him at first
except to remark his clothes, but as he came within
short vision Tanner gave a grunt of astonishment
and bit through the reed stem of his corn-cob
pipe.</p>
<p>He recognized the youth as the one he had seen
in St. John&rsquo;s and had referred to as the secretary to
the president of the Marine Insurance Company.</p>
<p>Instantly the old man&rsquo;s mind flashed back to what
he had heard only a week before, which he had
told Code. He stood looking after the stranger
as though spell-bound, his slow mind groping vainly
for some explanation of his presence in Freekirk
Head.</p>
<p>He felt instinctively that it must be in connection
with the case of Code Schofield and the <i>May</i>,
and his feeling was corroborated a moment later
when, from behind the trunk of a big pine-tree, Nat
Burns stepped forward and greeted the other.
They had apparently met before, for they shook
hands cordially and continued westward along the
King&rsquo;s Road.</p>
<p>A few steps brought them opposite the gate to
the Schofield cottage, and Bijonah, following their
motions like a hawk, saw Nat jerk his thumb in the
direction of the house as they walked past.</p>
<p>That was enough for Tanner. He was convinced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
now that the insurance man had come to carry
out the threat made in St. John&rsquo;s, and that Nat Burns
was more intimately connected with the scheme than
he had at first supposed.</p>
<p>Bijonah set down his package of groceries on the
counter inside and turned away toward the wharf
where the <i>Charming Lass</i> was tied up for a final
trimming. She already had her salt aboard and
most of her provisions and was being given her final
touches by Pete Ellinwood, Jimmie Thomas, and the
other members of the crew that had signed on to
sail in her.</p>
<p>Tanner hailed Ellinwood from the wharf and
beckoned so frantically that the big man swarmed
up the rigging to the dock as though he were going
aloft to reef a topsail in a half a gale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Code&rsquo;s in a pile of trouble,&rdquo; said the old man,
and went on briefly to narrate the whole circumstance
of the insurance company&rsquo;s possible move.
&ldquo;That feller came on the steamer this afternoon,
an&rsquo; if he serves Code with the summons or attachment
or whatever it is, it&rsquo;s my idea that the <i>Lass</i> will
never round the Swallowtail for the Banks. Where
is the boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Went up to Castalia to see a couple of men who
he thought he might get for the crew, but I don&rsquo;t
think Burns or any one else knows it. He wanted
to make the trip on the quiet an&rsquo; get them without
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
anybody&rsquo;s knowing it if he could. But what do you
cal&rsquo;late to do, Bige?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the Great Snood, I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; declared
Tanner helplessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; said Pete reassuringly, &ldquo;you just let me
handle this little trouble myself. We&rsquo;ll have the
skipper safe an&rsquo; clear if we have to commit murder
to do it. Now, Bige, you just keep your mouth
shut and don&rsquo;t worry no more. I&rsquo;ll do the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feeling the responsibility to be in capable hands
and secretly glad to escape events that might be too
much for his years, Captain Tanner walked back to
the road, secured his package of groceries at the
store, and made his way home to the widow Sprague&rsquo;s
house.</p>
<p>For five minutes Pete Ellinwood lounged indolently
against a spile, engrossed in thought. Then
he put on his coat and crossed the King&rsquo;s Road to
the Schofield cottage.</p>
<p>He had hardly opened the gate when a strange
youth in a gray suit and Panama hat came out of the
front door and down the path. Pete recognized
the newcomer from St. John&rsquo;s, and the newcomer evidently
recognized him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! Captain Code Schofield, I presume,&rdquo; he
announced, thrusting his hand nervously into his
pocket and bringing out a fistful of papers. So
eager and excited was he that, unnoticed, he dropped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
one flimsy sheet, many times folded, into the grass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not Schofield,&rdquo; rumbled Ellinwood
from the depths of his mighty chest. &ldquo;Get along
with you now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please accept service of this paper, Captain
Schofield,&rdquo; said the other, extending a legal-looking
document, and shrugging his shoulders as though to
say that Pete&rsquo;s denial of identity was, of course, only
natural, but could hardly be indulged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not Schofield!&rdquo; bellowed Pete, outraged.
&ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Ellinwood, an&rsquo; anybody&rsquo;ll tell you so.
I won&rsquo;t take your durned paper. If you want Schofield
find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man drew back, nonplussed, but might
have continued his attentions had not a passer-by
come to Pete&rsquo;s rescue and sworn to his identity.
Only then did the young lawyer&ndash;&ndash;for he was that
as well as private secretary&ndash;&ndash;withdraw with short
and grudged apologies.</p>
<p>Pete, growling to himself like a great bear, was
starting forward to the house when his eye was
caught by the folded paper that had dropped from
the packet in the lawyer&rsquo;s hand. He stooped, picked
it up, and, with a glance about, to prove that the
other was out of sight, opened it.</p>
<p>As he read it his eyes widened and his jaw dropped
with astonishment. Twice he slowly spelled out
the words before him, and then, with a low whistle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
and a gigantic wink, thrust the paper carefully into
his pocket and pinned the pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be news to the lad, sure enough,&rdquo; he
said, continuing on his way toward the house.</p>
<p>The little orphan girl Josie admitted him. He
found Mrs. Schofield on the verge of tears. She
had just been through a long and painful interview
with the newcomer, and had barely recovered from
the shock of what he had to tell.</p>
<p>Code, since learning of what was in the air, had
not told his mother, for he did not wish to alarm
her unnecessarily, and was confident he would get
away to the Banks before the slow-moving St. John
firm took action.</p>
<p>Pete, smitten mightily by the distress of the
comely middle-aged widow, melted to a misery of
unexpressible tenderness and solicitude. In his
words and actions of comfort he resembled a great,
loving St. Bernard dog who had accidentally knocked
down a toddling child and is desirous of making
amends. Ma Schofield took note of his desire to
lighten her burden, and presently permitted it to be
lightened.</p>
<p>Then they talked over the situation, and Pete
finally said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sending Jimmie Thomas down to Castalia
in his motor-dory to find Code. Of course, the
skipper took his own dory, and we may meet him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
coming back. What we want to do is head him off
an&rsquo; keep him away from here. Now, there&rsquo;s no
tellin&rsquo; how long he might have to stay away, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve
been figgerin&rsquo; that perhaps if you was to take him
a bundle of clothes it wouldn&rsquo;t go amiss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; announced ma sturdily. &ldquo;Just you
tell Jimmie to wait a quarter of an hour and I&rsquo;ll
be along. Now, Pete Ellinwood, listen here.
What scheme have you got in your mind? I can
see by your eyes that there is one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May!&rdquo; cried Pete reproachfully. &ldquo;How
could I have anythin&rsquo; in my mind without tellin&rsquo;
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when he walked out of the cottage
door it was to chuckle enormously in his black
beard and call himself names that he had to deceive
May.</p>
<p>He called Jimmie Thomas up from the duties
of the paint-pot and brush, and gave him instructions
as to what to do. They talked rapidly in
low tones until Mrs. Schofield appeared; then
Jimmie helped her into the motor-dory and both
men pushed off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late I&rsquo;ll have it all worked out when you
come back, Jim,&rdquo; said Pete as the engine caught
the spark and the dory moved away.</p>
<p>Mrs. Schofield turned around and fixed her sharp,
blue eyes upon the giant ashore.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Peter!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I knew there was some
scheme. When I get back&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the rest was lost, for distance had overcome
her voice. Ellinwood stood and grinned benignly
at his goddess. Then he slapped his thigh with
an eleven-inch hand and made a noise with his mouth
like a man clucking to his horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sprightly as a gal, she is,&rdquo; he allowed.
&ldquo;Dummed if she ain&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>JIMMIE THOMAS&rsquo;S STRATEGY</h3>
</div>
<p>On a chart the island of Grande Mignon bears
the same relation to surrounding islands that
a mother-ship bears to a flock of submarines.
Westward her coast is rocky and forbidding, being
nothing but a succession of frowning headlands
that rise almost perpendicularly from the sea. It
is one of the most desolate stretches of coast in
moderate latitudes, for no one lives there, nor has
ever lived there, except a few hermit dulce-pickers
during the summer months.</p>
<p>Along the east coast, that looks across the Atlantic,
are strung the villages, nestled in bays and coves.
And it is out from this coast that the dozen little
islands lie. First, and partially across the mouth
of the bay where the fishing fleet lies, is Long
Island. Then comes High Duck, Low Duck, and
Big Duck. Farther south there are Ross&rsquo;s, Whitehead,
and Big Wood islands, not to mention spits,
points, and ledges of rock innumerable and all
honored with names.</p>
<p>It was the fact of so many treacherous ledges and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
reefs to be navigated safely in a four-knot tide that
was agitating the half-dozen &ldquo;guests&rdquo; at Mis&rsquo;
Shannon&rsquo;s boarding-house. It need hardly be said
that Mis&rsquo; Shannon was a widow, but her distinction
lay in being called mis&rsquo; instead of ma.</p>
<p>She made a livelihood by putting up the &ldquo;runners&rdquo;
who made periodical trips with their sample
cases for the benefit of the local tradesmen, and
took in occasional &ldquo;rusticators,&rdquo; or summer tourists
who had courage enough to dare the passage of the
strait in the tiny steamer.</p>
<p>The principal auditor of the harrowing tales that
were flying about the table over the fish chowder was
Mr. Aubrey Templeton, the young lawyer from St.
John&rsquo;s who had arrived on the steamer that afternoon.
Just opposite to Mr. Templeton at the table
sat Jimmie Thomas, who, being a bachelor, had made
his home with Miss Shannon for the last three years.
And it was Jimmie who had held the table spell-bound
with his tales of danger and narrow escapes.</p>
<p>He had just concluded a yarn, told in all seriousness,
of how a shark had leaped over the back of
a dory in Whale Cove and the two men in the dory
had barely escaped with their lives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I know the two men it happened to,&rdquo; he
concluded; &ldquo;or I know one of &rsquo;em; the other&rsquo;s
dead. Ol&rsquo; Jasper Schofield never got over the
scare he got that day.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></div>
<p>The lawyer sat bolt upright in his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know the Schofields?&rdquo; he demanded
of Thomas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I ought to. I&rsquo;ve been dorymate with
Code when the old man was skipper. A finer young
feller ain&rsquo;t on this island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you happen to know where he is?&rdquo; asked
Templeton. &ldquo;I came to Grande Mignon on several
important matters, and one of them was to see him.
I&rsquo;ve tried to locate the fellow, but he seems to have
disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I seen him to-day myself in Castalia!&rdquo;
cried Thomas. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s up there hirin&rsquo; men to ship
with him. Said he was goin&rsquo; to stay all night.
I know the very house he&rsquo;s in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I could get there to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might.&rdquo; Jimmie looked at his watch.
&ldquo;The Seal Cove mail-wagon&rsquo;s gone long ago, but
I&rsquo;ll take you down in my motor-dory if you&rsquo;ll come
right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Templeton did not even wait to finish his supper,
but went out with Thomas immediately. A
few minutes&rsquo; walk brought them to the little beach
where the dory was drawn up and they were soon
on their way. But before they left, Templeton
scribbled a message on a piece of paper and left it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
with Mrs. Shannon to be given to Nat Burns, who,
he said, was to call for him at half-past seven.</p>
<p>Thomas kept the nose of his dory pointed to the
lights of several houses that gleamed across the bay.
They were not, however, the lights of Castalia,
which were almost invisible farther south. But
Templeton, who had never been on Grande Mignon
before, sat blissfully ignorant of this circumstance.</p>
<p>Later, however, he remembered that his accommodating
guide had chuckled inexplicably during
most of the trip.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes&rsquo; ride in the chill night air
brought them to a long, low pier that extended out
into the black water. Above on the hillside the
windows of the big fishing settlement on Long
Island gleamed comfortable and yellow.</p>
<p>Thomas ran his dory close to the landing-stage
and then reversed the engine so that at the time
most convenient for Templeton to step off the boat
had lost all motion. The lawyer landed, but
Jimmie did not shut off his engine. Instead he
turned it on full speed and backed away from the
dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, you, where are you going?&rdquo; called Templeton,
vaguely alarmed for the first time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back to the village,&rdquo; answered Thomas, sending
his motor into the forward speed. &ldquo;I got something
very important to do there.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But in which house is Schofield?&rdquo; cried the
other. &ldquo;You said you would show me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no reply, and it is possible that, due
to the noise of the engine, Thomas had not heard
the protest at all.</p>
<p>Nat Burns arrived at Shannon&rsquo;s boarding-house
slightly in advance of the time named, and read
Templeton&rsquo;s note saying that he had gone to Castalia
to nab Code while he had the chance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who did Templeton go with?&rdquo; he asked fearfully
of the landlady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Thomas,&rdquo; replied that worthy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; rapped out Burns in such a tone
of disgust and defeat that she shrank from him with
uplifted hands. But he did not notice her. Instead
he rushed out of the house and along the road
toward Freekirk Head.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The boarding-house was a full half-mile from the
wharfs of the village, and after a hundred yards
Burns slowed down into a rapid walk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fool took the bait like a dogfish,&rdquo; he
snarled. &ldquo;Lord knows where he is by this time.
I&rsquo;ll bet Schofield is at the bottom of this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had not as yet found out where Code was,
and his first step when he reached the village was
to go to the Schofield cottage and verify Templeton&rsquo;s
note.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></div>
<p>Josie, the orphan girl, was there alone, and was
on the point of tears with having been left alone so
long with night coming on.</p>
<p>When questioned the girl admitted readily enough
that Mrs. Schofield had taken a bundle of Code&rsquo;s
clothing and gone to Castalia in the afternoon, she
having overheard the conversation that took place
between her mistress and Pete Ellinwood.</p>
<p>When he had gained this information Burns
hurried from the house and toward the spot on the
beach between the wharfs where his dory lay.</p>
<p>He had not the remotest idea what had become
of Templeton, but he was reasonably sure that if
Thomas had taken him to Castalia, Schofield was no
longer there.</p>
<p>What Thomas had really done did not occur to
him, and his one idea was to get to the neighboring
village as soon as possible and ascertain just what
had taken place.</p>
<p>His dory was beached alongside the pier where
the <i>Charming Lass</i> had lain for the past week.
Now, as he approached it, he suddenly stopped,
rooted in his tracks.</p>
<p>The <i>Charming Lass</i> was gone.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />
<div class='chsp'>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
<a name='CHAPTER_IX_ON_THE_COURSE' id='CHAPTER_IX_ON_THE_COURSE'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>ON THE COURSE</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;All dories aboard? All hands set tops&rsquo;ls!
Jimmie Thomas, ease your mainsheet!
Now, boys, altogether! Yo! Sway &rsquo;em
flat! Yo! Once more! Yo! Fine! Stand by to
set balloon jib!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was broad daylight, and the early sun lighted
the newly painted, slanting deck of the <i>Charming
Lass</i> as she snored through the gentle sea. On
every side the dark gray expanse stretched unbroken
to the horizon, except on the starboard bow. There
a long, gray flatness separated itself from the horizon&ndash;&ndash;the
coast of southern Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>There was a favorable following wind, and the
clean, new schooner seemed to express her joy at
being again in her element by leaping across the
choppy waves like a live thing.</p>
<p>While the crew of ten leaped to the orders, Code
Schofield stood calmly at the wheel, easing her on
her course, so as to give them the least trouble. Under
the vociferous bellow of Pete Ellinwood, the
crew were working miracles in swiftness and organization.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></div>
<p>The sun had been up two hours, and now, as Schofield
glanced back at the wake that foamed and
bubbled behind them, his eyes fell upon the white
sails of a vessel far astern. Even at the distance,
it was plain that she was of schooner rig, and probably
a fisherman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder who she is?&rdquo; asked Code, pointing her
out to Ellinwood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. Thought perhaps you&rsquo;d seen her
before, skipper. I&rsquo;ve had my eye on her for an
hour. Fisherman, likely; you&rsquo;ll see &rsquo;em in all directions
every day afore we&rsquo;re through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The explanation was simple and obvious, and it
satisfied Schofield. He promptly forgot her, as did
every one else aboard the <i>Lass</i>. And reason enough.
The cook, sticking his head out of the galley, bawled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mug-up! First ta-a-able!&rdquo; and the first table
made a rush below.</p>
<p>When the five men sat down it was the first time
they had been able to relax since the evening before,
when, without lights, and under headsails only, the
<i>Charming Lass</i> had stolen out between the reefs of
Freekirk Head to sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, boys, I cal&rsquo;late we&rsquo;re safe!&rdquo; ejaculated Ellinwood
with great satisfaction. &ldquo;The <i>Lass</i> is doin&rsquo;
her ten knot steady, an&rsquo; I guess we&rsquo;ll have left Cape
Sable astern afore the sleepy heads at home find
out what&rsquo;s become of us.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You saved the day, Pete. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for
you I would never have got beyond St. John&rsquo;s.&rdquo; It
was Code who spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you pretty near spoiled what I <i>did</i> do,&rdquo;
rumbled Pete.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; interrupted Thomas interestedly.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know everything that happened to you fellers.
I was busy at the time givin&rsquo; a friend of ours
a joy-ride. Tell me about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t me that nearly broke up the show,
Pete,&rdquo; protested Code. &ldquo;It was mother. Of
course, when Jimmie was taking her over to Castalia
in his dory he told her what was in the wind. They
found me at the Pembroke place, and we all went
into Pembroke&rsquo;s ice-house, where I was to stay until
after dark. Then ma started in to find out everything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She allowed it wasn&rsquo;t honorable for me to run
away when the officer or lawyer was after me. She
said it proved that I was guilty, and thought I ought
to stay and be served with his paper. If I wasn&rsquo;t
guilty of anything, it could be proven easily enough,
she said. Poor, honest mother! She forgot that
the whole matter would take weeks, if not months,
and that all that time I would be idle and discontented,
and spending most of my time before boards
of inquiry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it <i>will</i> look queer to a lot of people at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
the Head because I&rsquo;ve gone. They&rsquo;ll say right off:
&lsquo;Just as we thought! All this talk that has been
going around is true,&rsquo; and put me down for a criminal
that ought to go to jail. That&rsquo;s what mother
said, and the worst part of leaving her now is that
she will have to stay and face the talk&ndash;&ndash;and the
looks that are worse than talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Jimmie, I couldn&rsquo;t do it. Grande Mignon
is in too bad a hole. She needs every man who owns
a schooner or a sloop or a dory to go out and catch
fish and bring &rsquo;em home. The old island&rsquo;s got her
back against the wall, and I felt that when all the
trouble and danger were over for her I would go
to St. John&rsquo;s, and let those people try and prove
their case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t prove anything! But that doesn&rsquo;t
say they won&rsquo;t get a judgment. I&rsquo;m poor and unknown,
and ignorant of law. The company is a big
corporation, with lawyers and plenty of money. If
somebody there is after me I haven&rsquo;t a chance, and
they will gouge me for all they can get. You, Jimmie,
and Pete know that this is so, and it was for all
these reasons that I wouldn&rsquo;t stand my ground and let
that feller serve me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ma is dependent on me, and when I have sold
fifteen hundred quintals of fish she will have enough
to carry her along until that trouble is over. So I&rsquo;m
going out after the fifteen hundred quintals. Now,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
that&rsquo;s my story. We&rsquo;ve heard Jimmie&rsquo;s; but how
did you manage everything so well, Pete?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellinwood was flattered and coughed violently
over the last of his victuals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; yelled some hungry member of the second
half. &ldquo;If you fellers eat any more you&rsquo;ll sink
the ship. Get up out o&rsquo; there an&rsquo; give yer betters a
chance!&rdquo; Ellinwood rolled a forbidding eye toward
the companionway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some clam-splitter on deck don&rsquo;t seem to know
that in this here packet the youth an&rsquo; beauty is allus
considered fust,&rdquo; he rumbled ominously. No reply
being forthcoming, he turned to Code.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When ol&rsquo; Bige Tanner come to me shakin&rsquo; like
a leaf an&rsquo; said they was a feller on the steamer that
would attach yer schooner an&rsquo; all that ye had, because
of some business about the sinkin&rsquo; of the ol&rsquo;
<i>May</i>, I says to myself, sez I:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Pete,&rsquo; I sez, &lsquo;we don&rsquo;t allow nothin&rsquo; like that
to spoil our cruise an&rsquo; keep the skipper ashore.&rsquo;
Now, Mignon isn&rsquo;t very big, an&rsquo; I knew he would git
you in a day or two if you didn&rsquo;t go back into the
forest and hide. But I cal&rsquo;lated you wouldn&rsquo;t want
to do that, an&rsquo; so I figgered the only way to beat that
lawyer was to fool him before he got fair started on
his search.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knowed you was in Castalia, an&rsquo; so I thought
your mother better get you some clothes an&rsquo; bring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
&rsquo;em there. I found out that Nat Burns had taken
the feller to Mis&rsquo; Shannon&rsquo;s boardin&rsquo;-house, an&rsquo;,
knowin&rsquo; that Jimmie was livin&rsquo; there, I got an idee.
Jimmie&rsquo;s told about that already. The feller bit,
an&rsquo; that was the end of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that wasn&rsquo;t the wust of it. I knew we had
to get out the same evenin&rsquo; if we was to git out at all,
so what did I do but get Bill Rockwell here to hitch
up his big double buckboard an&rsquo; go out after the five
men that weren&rsquo;t on the job.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had to drive clear to Great Harbor for one,
but he got back with all hands about seven o&rsquo;clock.
Everybody in town was at supper, an&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t see us
when we clumb aboard the <i>Lass</i>. When it was pitch-black
we cast off the lines, an&rsquo; she drifted out on the
ebb tide, which just there runs easy a knot an&rsquo; a half.
Then we got up our headsails so as to get steerage-way
on her, and bless my soul if the blocks made a
creak! Might have been pullin&rsquo; silk thread through
a fur mitten, for all the noise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was afraid fer a minute that the flash of Swallowtail
Light would catch her topm&rsquo;sts, but it didn&rsquo;t,
and after an hour we were outside and layin&rsquo; in sixteen
fathom off Big Duck. The tide there runs
three knot, and, with our headsails an&rsquo; the light air
o&rsquo; wind, we just managed to hold her even.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, you fellers know the rest. As soon
as Jimmie landed his passenger on Long Island he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
came out an&rsquo; straight south to where we was. I had
told Jimmie to tell Code in the afternoon where to
meet us; and so, when it was black enough, the skipper
got into his motor-dory and came out, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they climbed aboard we got up sail and
laid a southwest course to round Nova Scoshy; an&rsquo;
here we are, nearin&rsquo; Cape Race already, and dummed
proud of ourselves, if I do say it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Proud of you, Pete, you old fox,&rdquo; said Schofield,
getting up from the table with a sigh of immense relief.
&ldquo;Come on; let the second half in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, skipper,&rdquo; said Pete, rising to his great
height and wiping his mouth with the back of his
huge hand. &ldquo;But wait! I almost fergot this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He unpinned the pocket of his waistcoat and drew
forth the flimsy sheet of paper that he had picked up
when Templeton had mistakenly tried to serve him.</p>
<p>Briefly he told the skipper its history and handed
it to him. Schofield&rsquo;s eyes opened wide as he saw
that the paper was that of the Dominion Cable office
in Freekirk Head, and he read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class='lalign'>&ldquo;To A. TEMPLETON,<br />
<span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Marine Insurance Company,<br />
<span class='indent4'>&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;St. John&rsquo;s, N.B.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come at once with summons for Cody
Albert Schofield and attachment for schooner
Charming Lass, as per former arrangements.</p>
<p class='ralign'>&ldquo;BURNETT.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span></div>
<p>For a moment the signature puzzled him, and Ellinwood,
grinning, stood watching his puzzled efforts
to solve it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Skipper, if it was a mule it would kick you in the
face,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t see Nat Burns
in that, I can. And now you&rsquo;ve got an idea just
who&rsquo;s at the bottom of this thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Code Schofield went aft to his cabin companionway,
and prepared to go below and open his log.
Kent took the wheel, and Ellinwood lurched about
with a critical eye upon the lashings, sheets, and general
appearance of the deck.</p>
<p>Schofield, remembering the schooner that had attracted
his eye before, looked astern for her. She
had gained rapidly upon them in the half-hour he
had been below. Now he could see her graceful
black hull, the shadows in the great sails, and the
tiny men here and there upon her deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a sailer!&rdquo; he cried in involuntary admiration.
&ldquo;She must be an American!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was clear that the other schooner, even in that
moderate breeze, must be making the better side of
twelve knots. Schofield gave her a final admiring
glance and went below.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>A MYSTERY</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;AUGUST 29:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clear. Wind W.S.W., canting to W.
Moderate breeze. Knots logged to
twelve, noon, 153. Position, 20 miles south, a little
east of Cape Sable. End of this day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Code closed the dirty and thumb-worn, paper-covered
ledger that was the log of the Charming Lass
and had been the log of the old May Schofield for
ten years before she went down. It was the one
thing he had saved. He had been on deck, taken his
sextant observation, and just completed working out
his position.</p>
<p>As he closed the old log his eye was caught by a
crudely penned name near the bottom of the paper
cover. The signature was Nellie Tanner&rsquo;s, and he
remembered how, a dozen years ago, while they
were playing together in the cabin of the old May,
she had pretended she was captain and owned the
whole boat, so that Code would have to obey her orders.</p>
<p>As he looked he caught the almost obliterated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
marks of a pencil beneath Nellie&rsquo;s name, and, looking
closer, discovered &ldquo;Nat Burns&rdquo; in boyish
letters.</p>
<p>For a moment he scowled blackly at the audacious
words, and then, laughing at his foolishness, threw
the book from him. Then slowly the scowl returned,
and he asked himself seriously why Nat
hated him so.</p>
<p>That there had always been an instinctive dislike
between them as boys, everybody in Freekirk Head
knew, and several vicious fights to a finish had emphasized
it.</p>
<p>But since coming to manhood&rsquo;s estate Code had
left behind him much of the rancor and intolerance of
his early youth, and had considered Nat Burns
merely as a disagreeable person to be left heartily
alone.</p>
<p>But Burns had evidently not arrived at this mature
point of self-education. In fact, Burns was a good
example of a youth brought up without those powers
of self-control that are absolutely necessary to any
one who expects to take a reasonable position in society
even as simple as that of Freekirk Head.</p>
<p>Code remembered that Nat and his father had always
been inseparable companions, and that it was
due to this father more than any one else that the
boy had been spoiled and indulged in every way.</p>
<p>Michael Burns had risen to a position of considerable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
power in the humble life of the island. From
a successful trawler he had become a successful fish-packer
and shipper. Then he had felt a desire to
spread his affluent wings, gone in for politics, and
been appointed the squire or justice of the peace.</p>
<p>In this position he was commissioned by the
Marine Insurance Company of St. John&rsquo;s as its agent
and inspector on Grande Mignon Island. In his
less successful days he had been a boat-builder in
Gloucester and Bath, and knew much of ship construction.</p>
<p>For more than half a year now Code had been unable
to think of Michael Burns or the old <i>May Schofield</i>
without a shudder of horror. But now that
Nat was suddenly hot on the trail of revenge, he
knew he must look at matters squarely and prepare
to meet any trap which might be laid for him.</p>
<p>It seemed evident that the first aim in Nat&rsquo;s mind
was the hounding of the man who had been the cause
of his father&rsquo;s death; for that death had occurred at
a most opportune time for the Schofields.</p>
<p>The heavy insurance on the fifty-year-old <i>May</i> was
about to run out, and it was almost a certainty that
Burns would not recommend its renewal except at a
vastly increased premium.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, on a hurried trip that Code
had taken, he had picked up Burns himself at St.
John&rsquo;s, the inspector coming for the purpose of examining
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
the schooner while under sail in a fairly
heavy seaway.</p>
<p>All the island knew this, and all the island knew
that Code was the only one to return alive. The inference
was not hard to deduce, especially as the gale
encountered had been one such as the <i>May</i> had lived
out a dozen times.</p>
<p>Had not all these things been enough to fire the
impulsive, passionate Burns with a sullen hatred, the
next events would have been. For Code received his
insurance without a dispute and, not long afterward,
while in Boston for the purpose, had picked up the
almost new <i>Charming Lass</i> from a Gloucester skipper
who had run into debt.</p>
<p>Code now saw to what Nat&rsquo;s uncontrolled brooding
had brought him, and he realized that the battle
would be one of wits.</p>
<p>He got up to go on deck. He had only turned to
the companionway when the great voice of Pete Ellinwood
rumbled down to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on deck, skipper, an&rsquo; look over this
schooner astern of us. There&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; queer
about her. I don&rsquo;t like her actions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Code took the steps at a jump, and a moment later
stood beside Ellinwood. The <i>Lass</i> was snoring
along under full sail.</p>
<p>The stranger, which at eight o&rsquo;clock had been five
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
miles astern, was now, at noon, less than a mile
away.</p>
<p>Code instinctively shot a quick glance at the compass.
The schooner was running dead east.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this, Ellinwood?&rdquo; demanded the skipper
sharply. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re away off your course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, and on purpose,&rdquo; replied the mate.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been watchin&rsquo; that packet for a couple of
hours back and it seemed to me she was a little bit
too close on our track for comfort. &lsquo;What if she&rsquo;s
from St. John&rsquo;s?&rsquo; I sez to myself. &lsquo;Then there&rsquo;ll be
the devil to pay for the skipper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, after you&rsquo;d got your observation and went
below I just put the wheel down a trifle. I hadn&rsquo;t
been gone away from her five minutes when she followed.
It&rsquo;s very plain, Code, that she&rsquo;s tryin&rsquo; to
catch us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sudden feeling of alarm took possession of
Schofield. That she was a wonderful speed craft
she had already proven by overhauling the <i>Lass</i> so
easily. The thought immediately came to him that
Nat Burns, on discovering his absence, had sent the
lawyer with the summons to St. John&rsquo;s, hired a fast
schooner, and set out in pursuit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it was only an accident,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She
may be on the course to Sable Island. Give her another
trial. Come about and head for Halifax.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Stand by to come about,&rdquo; bawled Ellinwood.</p>
<p>Two young fellows raced up the rigging, others
stood by to prevent jibing, and the mate put the wheel
hard alee. The schooner&rsquo;s head swung sharply,
there was a thunder and rattle of canvas, a patter of
reef points, and the great booms swung over. The
wind caught the sails, the <i>Charming Lass</i> heeled and
bore away on the new course.</p>
<p>The men in the stern watched the movements of
the stranger anxiously.</p>
<p>Ten minutes had hardly elapsed when she also
came about and headed directly into the wake of the
<i>Lass</i>. Schofield and Ellinwood looked at each other
blankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you goin&rsquo; to run fer it, skipper?&rdquo; asked the
mate. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have the balloon jib and stays&rsquo;l set in
five minutes, if you say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Code thought for a minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d catch us, anyway.
Let &rsquo;em come up and we&rsquo;ll find out what they
want. Take in your tops&rsquo;ls. There&rsquo;s no use wasting
time on the wrong course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under reduced sail the <i>Lass</i> slowed, and the pursuing
vessel overhauled them rapidly. With a great
smother of foam at her bows she ducked into the
choppy sea and came like a race horse. In half an
hour she was almost abreast on the port quarter. A
man with a megaphone appeared on her poop deck
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
and leveled the instrument at the little group by the
wheel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heave to!&rdquo; he bawled. &ldquo;We want to talk
with ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heave to!&rdquo; ordered Code, and the <i>Charming
Lass</i> came up into the wind just as the stranger accomplished
the same maneuver. They were now less
than fifty yards away and the man again leveled his
megaphone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the <i>Charming Lass</i> out of Freekirk
Head?&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Code Schofield in command?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bound to the Banks on a fishin&rsquo; cruise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; that&rsquo;s all I wanted to know,&rdquo; said the
man, and set down the megaphone. He gave some
rapid orders to the crew, and his vessel swung around
so as to catch the wind again.</p>
<p>Code and Ellinwood looked at one another
blankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey there!&rdquo; shouted Schofield at the top of his
voice. &ldquo;Who are you and what do you want?&rdquo;
The skipper of the other schooner paid no attention
whatever, and Schofield repeated his question, this
time angrily.</p>
<p>He might as well have shouted at the wind. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
stranger&rsquo;s head fell off, her canvas caught the breeze,
and she forged ahead. A minute later and she was
out of earshot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look for her name on the stern,&rdquo; commanded
Code. He plunged below into the cabin and raced
up again with his glasses. The mysterious schooner
was now nearly a quarter of a mile away, but within
easy range of vision.</p>
<p>Code fixed his gaze on her stern, where her name
should be, and saw with astonishment that it had
carefully been painted out. Then he swung his
glasses to cover the dories nested amidships, and
found that on them, too, new paint had obscured the
name. He lowered the glasses helplessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you recognize her, Pete?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I
know most of the schooners out of Freekirk Head
and St. John&rsquo;s, but I never saw her before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me neither,&rdquo; admitted the mate, with conviction.
&ldquo;I wonder what all this means?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Code could not answer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>IN THE FOG BANK</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;SQUID ho! Squid ho! Tumble up, all
hands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rod Kent, the old salt who had for the
past hour been experimenting over the side, leaned
down the main cabin hatch and woke the port watch.
Behind him on the deck a queer marine creature
squirmed in a pool of water and sought vainly to disentangle
itself from the apparatus that had caught
it.</p>
<p>The shout brought all hands on deck, stupid with
sleep, but eager to join in the sport.</p>
<p>The squid is a very small edition of the giant
devilfish or octopus. It has ten tentacles, a tapered
body about ten inches long, and is armed with the
usual defensive ink-sac, by means of which it squirts
a cloud of black fluid at a pursuing enemy, escaping
in the general murk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d ye ketch him?&rdquo; cried all hands, for the
advent of squid was the most welcome news the men
on the <i>Charming Lass</i> had had since leaving home
four days before. It meant that this favorite and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
succulent bait of the roaming cod had arrived on the
Banks, and that the catches would be good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jigged him,&rdquo; replied Kent laconically. He disengaged
the struggling squid from the apparatus and
examined the latter carefully. It was made of a
single cork, through the lower edge of which pins had
been thrust and bent back like the flukes of an anchor.
To it was fastened a small shred of red flannel, the
whole being attached to a line with a sinker.</p>
<p>In five minutes Code had unearthed from an old
shoe-box in his cabin enough jigs to supply all hands,
and presently both rails were lined with men hauling
up the bait as fast as it was lured to close proximity
by the color of the red flannel. Once the creatures
had wrapped themselves around the cork a sharp
jerk impaled them on the pins, and up they
came.</p>
<p>But not without resistance. Just as they left the
water they discharged their ink-sacs at their captors,
and the men on the decks of the <i>Lass</i> were kept busy
weaving their heads from side to side, to avoid the
assault.</p>
<p>It was near evening of the second day after the
mysterious schooner had hailed them and sailed
away. Since that time they had forged steadily
northeast, along the coast of Nova Scotia. At last
they had left Cape Breton at the tip of Cape Breton
Island behind them and approached the southern
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
shores of Newfoundland and that wonderful stretch
of shoals called the Grand Banks.</p>
<p>Southeast for three hundred miles from Newfoundland
extends this under-sea flooring of rocky
shelves, that run from ninety to five fathoms, being
most shallow at Virgin Rocks.</p>
<p>In reality this is a great submarine mountain chain
that is believed at one time to have belonged to the
continent of North America. The outside edge of
it is in the welter of the shoreless Atlantic, and from
this edge there is a sheer drop into almost unsounded
depths. These depths have got the name of the
Whale Hole, and many a fishing skipper has dropped
his anchor into this abyss and earned the laughter of
his crew when he could find no ground.</p>
<p>Along the top and sides of this mountain range
grow vegetable substances and small animalcules that
provide excellent feeding for the vast hosts of cod
that yearly swim across it. For four hundred years
the cod have visited these feeding grounds and been
the prey of man, yet their numbers show no falling
off.</p>
<p>To them is due the wealth of Newfoundland, the
Miquelon Islands, Nova Scotia, Labrador, and
Prince Edward Island.</p>
<p>The first manifestation of the annual visit is the
arrival of enormous schools of caplin, a little silvery
fish some seven inches long that invades the bays and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
the open sea. Close upon them follow the cod, feeding
as they come. The caplin last six weeks and disappear,
to be superseded in August by the squid, of
which the cod are very fond.</p>
<p>Up until fifty years ago mackerel were caught on
the Banks, and large quantities of halibut, but the
mackerel disappeared suddenly, never to return, and
the halibut became constantly more rare, until at last
only the cod remained.</p>
<p>Aboard the <i>Charming Lass</i> the squid &ldquo;jigging&rdquo;
went on for a couple of hours. Then suddenly the
school passed and the sport ended abruptly.</p>
<p>But the deck of the schooner was a mass of the
bait, and the tubs of salt clams brought from Freekirk
Head could be saved until later.</p>
<p>Rockwell, who had been looking out forward, suddenly
called Code&rsquo;s attention to a flock of sea-pigeons
floating on the water a mile ahead. As the skipper
looked he saw the fowl busily diving and &ldquo;upending,&rdquo;
and he knew they had struck the edge of the
Banks; for water-fowl will always dive in shoal
water, and a skipper sailing to the Banks from a distance
always looks for this sign.</p>
<p>An hour later, when the cook had sent out his call
for the first half, Code made Ellinwood stay on deck
and bring the schooner to an anchorage after sounding.</p>
<p>The sounding lead is a long slug, something like a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
window-weight, at the bottom of which is a saucer-shaped
hollow. The leadsman, a young fellow from
Freekirk Head, took his place on the schooner&rsquo;s rail
outside the forerigging. The lead was attached to
a line and, as the schooner forged slowly ahead, close-hauled,
the youth swung the lead in ever-widening
semicircles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let your pigeon fly!&rdquo; cried Pete, and the lead
swung far ahead and fell with a sullen <i>plop</i> into the
dark blue water. The line ran out until it suddenly
slackened just under the leadsman. He fingered a
mark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forty fathoms!&rdquo; he called.</p>
<p>Five minutes later another sounding was taken
and proved that the water was gradually shoaling.
At thirty fathoms Pete ordered the anchor let go
and a last sounding taken.</p>
<p>Before the lead flew he rubbed a little tallow into
the saucer, and this, when it came up, was full of sand,
mud, and shells, telling the sort of bottom under the
schooner.</p>
<p>Pete called Code, and together they read it like a
book&ndash;&ndash;favorable fishing ground, though not the
best.</p>
<p>While the second half ate, the first half took in
all canvas and reefed it with the exception of the
mainsail. This was unbent entirely and stowed
away. In its place was bent on a riding sail, for until
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
their salt was all wet there would be very little
occasion for any sort of sailing, their only progress
being as they ambled leisurely from berth to berth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dories overside!&rdquo; sung out Code. &ldquo;Starboard
first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A rope made fast to a mainstay and furnished with
a hook at its end was slipped into a loop of rope at
one end of the dory. A similar device caught a
similar loop at the other end.</p>
<p>One strong pull and the dory rose out of the nest
of four others that lay just aft of the mainmast. A
hand swung her outboard and she was lowered away
until she danced on the water.</p>
<p>Jimmie Thomas leaped into her, received a tub
of briny squid, a dinner-horn, and a beaker of water,
besides his rectangular reels with their heavy cord,
leads, and two hooks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Overside port dory!&rdquo; came the command, and
Kent was sent on his way. Thus one after another
the men departed until on board the <i>Lass</i> there remained
only the cook and a boy helper. Code, as
well as Ellinwood, had gone out, for they wished to
test the fishing.</p>
<p>These dories were entirely different propositions
from the heavy motor-boats that the men used almost
entirely near the island. They were light, compact,
and properly big enough for only one man, although
they easily accommodated two.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></div>
<p>The motor dories of Thomas and Code were on
board, nested forward, but they were of little use
here, where only short distances are covered, and
those by rowing.</p>
<p>The nine dories drew away from the schooner,
each in a different direction, until they were a mile
or more apart.</p>
<p>Code threw over his little three-fluked anchor.
Then he baited his two hooks with bits of tentacle and
threw them overboard. With the big rectangular
reel in his left hand, he unwound as the leads drew
down until they fetched bottom and the line sagged.
Unreeling a couple more fathoms of line, he cast the
reel aside.</p>
<p>Then he hauled his leads up until he judged them
to be some six feet off the bottom and waited.</p>
<p>Almost instantly there was a sharp jerk, and Code,
with the skill of the trained fisherman, instantly responded
to it with a savage pull on the line and a
rapid hand-over-hand as he looped it into the dory.
The fish had struck on. The tough cord sung
against the gunnel, and at times it was all the skipper
could do to bring up his prize, for the great cod
darted here and there, dove, rushed, and struggled
to avert the end.</p>
<p>Thirty fathoms is a hundred and eighty feet, and,
with a huge and desperate fish disputing every inch
of the way, it becomes a seemingly endless labor.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
But at last Code, straining his eyes over the side,
caught a glimpse of quick circles of white in the
green and reached for the maul that was stuck under
a thwart.</p>
<p>Two more heaves and the cod, open-mouthed,
thrashed on the surface. A smart rap on the head
with the maul and he came into the dory quietly.
There were little pink crabs sticking to him and he
did not seem as fat as he should, although he topped
the fifty-pound mark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lousy!&rdquo; said Code. &ldquo;Lousy and hungry! It&rsquo;s
good fishing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a short, stout stick at hand he wrenched the
hook out of the cod&rsquo;s mouth, baited up, and cast
again. The descending bait was rushed and seized.
This time both hooks bore victims.</p>
<p>When there were no speckled cod on the hooks
there were silvery hake, velvety black pollock, beautiful
scarlet sea-perch that look like little old men,
and an occasional ugly dogfish with his Chinese jade
eyes.</p>
<p>When the dogfish came the men pulled up their
anchors and rowed a mile or so away, for where the
dogfish pursues all others fly. He has the shape and
traits of his merciless giant brother, the tiger-shark,
with the added menace of a horn full of poison in the
middle of his back instead of a dorsal fin; an evil,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
curved horn, the thrust of which can be nearly fatal
to a man.</p>
<p>The bottom of the dory became covered with a
flooring of liquid silver bodies that twined together
and rolled with the roll of the dory.</p>
<p>At five o&rsquo;clock Code wound his line on the reel
(he usually used two at a time, but one had been
plenty with such fishing), and started to pull for the
distant <i>Charming Lass</i>. He was now fully five miles
from her, and his nearest neighbor was Bill Kent,
three miles away. All hands were drawing in toward
her, for they knew they must take a quick mug-up
and then dress down until the last cod lay in his
shroud of salt.</p>
<p>The schooner lay to the northeast of Schofield, and
as he bent to his work he did not see a strange, level
mass of gray that advanced slowly toward him.
From a distance to the lay observer this mass would
have looked like an ordinary cloud-bank, but the experienced
eyes of a fisherman would have discerned
its ghastly gray hue and its flat contour.</p>
<p>All the afternoon there had been a freshening
breeze, and now Schofield found himself rowing
against a head sea that occasionally slapped over the
high bow of the dory and ran aft over the half ton
of fish that lay under his feet.</p>
<p>He had not pulled for fifteen minutes when the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
whole world about him was suddenly obscured by the
thick, woolly fog that swirled past on the wind. It
was as though an impenetrable wall had been suddenly
built up on all sides, a wall that offered no resistance
to his progress and yet no egress.</p>
<p>He immediately stopped rowing and rested his
oars, listening. No sound came to him except the
slap of the increasing waves and the occasional flap
of a wet fish in its last struggles.</p>
<p>He carried no pocket compass, and the light gave
no hint of the direction of the sun. In the five minutes
that he sat there the head of his dory swung
around and, even had he known the exact compass
direction of the <i>Charming Lass</i> before the fog, he
would have been unable to find it.</p>
<p>The situation did not alarm him in the least, for
he had experienced it often before. Reaching into
the bow, he drew out the dinner-horn that was part
of the equipment of the dory and sent an ear-splitting
blast out into the fog.</p>
<p>It seemed as though the opaque walls about him
held in the sound as heavy curtains might in a large
room; it fell dead on his own ears without any of the
reverberant power that sound has in traveling across
water.</p>
<p>Once more he listened. He knew that the
schooner, being at anchor, would be ringing her bell;
but he hardly hoped to catch a sound of that. Instead,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
he listened for the answering peal of a horn
in one of the other dories. Straining his ears, he
thought he caught a faint toot ahead of him and to
starboard.</p>
<p>He seized his oars and rowed hard for several
minutes in the direction of the sound. Then he
stopped, and, rising to his feet, sent another great
blast brawling forth into the fog. Once more he
listened, and again it seemed as though an answering
horn sounded in the distance. But it was fainter this
time.</p>
<p>A gust of wind, rougher than the others, swirled
the fog about him in great ghostly sheets, turning
and twisting it like the clouds of greasy smoke from
a fire of wet leaves. The dory rolled heavily, and
Code, losing his balance, sprawled forward on the
fish, the horn flying from his hand overboard as he
tried to save himself.</p>
<p>For a moment only it floated; and then, as he was
frantically swinging the dory to draw alongside, it
disappeared beneath the water with a low gurgle.</p>
<p>The situation was serious. He was unable to attract
attention, and must depend for his salvation
upon hearing the horns of the other dories as they
approached the schooner. Rowing hard all the time,
with frequent short pauses, he strained his ears for
the welcome sound.</p>
<p>Sometimes he thought he caught a faint, mellow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
call; but he soon recognized that these were deceptions,
produced in his ears by the memory of what he
had heard before. Impatiently he rowed on.</p>
<p>After a while he stopped. Since he could not get
track of any one, it was foolish to continue the effort,
for every stroke might take him farther and farther
out of hearing. On the other hand, if he were
headed in the right direction, another dory, trying
to find the schooner, might cross his path or come
within earshot.</p>
<p>He was still not in the least worried by the situation.
Men in much worse ones had been rescued
from them without thinking anything of them.</p>
<p>But the rising wind and sea gave him something to
think of. The waves found it a very easy matter to
climb aboard the heavily laden dory, and occasionally
he had to bail with the can in the bows provided for
the purpose.</p>
<p>An hour passed, and at the end of that time he
found that he was bailing almost constantly. There
was only one thing to do under the circumstances.
The gaff lay under his hand. This is a piece of
broom-handle, to the end of which a stout, sharp
hook is attached, and the instrument is used in landing
fish which are too heavy to swing inboard on the
slender fishing-line.</p>

By this time the wind was a gale<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></div>
<p>Code took the gaff and commenced to throw the
fish over the side one at a time. He hated the
waste of splendid cod, but things had now got to a
pass where his own comfort and safety were at stake.
Once the fish were gone, with the cleanliness of long
habit, he swabbed the bottom and sides of the dory
with an old rag and rinsed them with water which he
afterward bailed out.</p>
<p>The dory now rose high and dry on the waves;
But Code found it increasingly difficult to row because
the water tended to &ldquo;crab&rdquo; his oars and twist
them suddenly out of his hands.</p>
<p>To keep his head to the wind he paddled slowly,
listening for any sound of a boat.</p>
<p>Another hour passed and darkness began to come
down. The pearly gray fog lost its color and became
black, like smoke from a burning oil-tank. He
knew the sun was below the horizon. He wondered
if any of the other men had been caught. If none
were gone but himself, he reasoned, the schooner
would have come in search of him.</p>
<p>So, from listening for the horn of a dory, he tried
to catch the hoarse voice of a patent fog-horn that
would be grinding on the forecastle head.</p>
<p>By this time the wind was a gale, and he knew it
was driving him astern, despite his rowing. The
waves were no longer the little choppy seas that the
<i>Lass</i> had encountered since leaving Freekirk Head,
but hustling, slopping hills that attacked him in endless
and rapid succession. His progress was a continuous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
climb to one summit, followed by a dizzying
swoop into the following depth.</p>
<p>Each climb was punctuated at the top by a gallon
or so of water slopped into the dory from the crest
of the wave. These influxes became so frequent that
he was obliged to bail very often. Consequently he
unshipped one oar and, crawling to the stern, shipped
the other in the notch of the sternboard.</p>
<p>Here he sculled with one hand so as to keep the
dory&rsquo;s head to the wind, and bailed with the other.
Being aft, his weight caused the water to run down
to him, and he could thus perform the two operations
at the same time.</p>
<p>When pitch-blackness had come he knew that he
was out of reach of the schooner&rsquo;s horn. His only
chance lay in the fog&rsquo;s lifting or the passing of some
schooner.</p>
<p>His principal concern was for the wind. It was
just the time of year for those &ldquo;three-day&rdquo; nor&rsquo;-easters
that harry the entire coast of North America.
When the first excitement of his danger passed
he was assailed by the fierce hunger of nervous and
physical exhaustion, but there was no food aboard
the dory. He had, of course, the breaker of water
that was part of his regular equipment; but this was
more for use during a long day of fishing than for
the emergency of being lost at sea.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></div>
<p>He took a hearty drink and prepared for the long
watch of the night.</p>
<p>By a wax match several hours later he found that
it was midnight. His struggle with wind and sea
had now become unequal. He found it impractical
to remain longer in the stern attempting to scull. So
very cautiously he set about his last defensive measure.</p>
<p>Taking the two oars and the anchor, as well as the
thwarts, he bound them together securely with the
anchor roding. This drag he hove from the bow of
the dory, and it swung the boat&rsquo;s head into the wind.
Schofield, with the bailer in one hand, lay flat in the
bottom.</p>
<p>With the increasing sea, water splashed steadily
over the sides so that his exertions never ceased.
The chill of the night penetrated his soaked garments,
and this, with his exhaustion, produced a
stupor. The whistle of the wind and the hiss of
foaming crests became dream sounds.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>OUT OF FREEKIRK HEAD</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;OH, I wouldn&rsquo;t think of such a thing for a
minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Bijonah Turner waved his
hand with an air of finality and favored his daughter
with a glare meant to be pregnant with parental authority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, father, listen to reason!&rdquo; cried Nellie;
&ldquo;here is mother to take care of the three small children,
and here am I with nothing whatever to do. Be
sensible and let me go along. I certainly ought to be
able to help in some way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; expostulated the captain, &ldquo;girls don&rsquo;t go
on fishing-trips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose the cook should fall sick or be hurt,
then I would come in handy, wouldn&rsquo;t I? But all
this is not the real point. Things are different with
us than they have ever been before; we have no home,
and mother and the children have to board with Ma
Sprague. If I stayed here I should be a burden, and
I couldn&rsquo;t stand that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bijonah scratched his head and looked at the girl
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
helplessly. He had yet to score his first victory over
her in an argument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you asked your mother?&rdquo; he queried at
last, seeking his time-worn refuge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she, brightening at the imminence of
victory, &ldquo;and she says she thinks it will be just the
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Bijonah weakly; &ldquo;come along
then. But mind, you&rsquo;ll find things different. Your
mother is boss of any land she puts her foot on, but
once I get the <i>Rosan</i> past Swallowtail <i>my</i> word goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, daddy dear,&rdquo; laughed the girl; &ldquo;I
know you&rsquo;ll be just the finest captain I ever sailed
with.&rdquo; She kissed him impulsively and ran up-stairs
to tell her mother the good news.</p>
<p>The departure of the fleet from Grande Mignon
was a sad day in the history of the island.</p>
<p>The sun had hardly shown red and dripping from
the sea when all the inhabitants were astir. Men
from as far south as Seal Cove and Great Harbor
clattered up the King&rsquo;s Road in rickety vehicles, accompanied
by their families and their dunnage.</p>
<p>In Freekirk Head alone less than ten men would
be left ashore. Of these, one was Bill Boughton, the
storekeeper, who was to arrange for the disposal of
the catch; but the others were either incapacitated,
sick, or old. The five aged fishermen, who subsisted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
on the charity of the town, formed a delegation on
one stringpiece to wave the fleet farewell.</p>
<p>Altogether there were fifteen boats, ten schooners,
and five sloops, carrying in all more than a hundred
and twenty-five men. The whole resource of the
island had been expended to provide tubs of bait and
barrels of salt enough for all these, let alone the provisions.</p>
<p>The men either shipped on shares or, if they were
fearful of chance, at a fixed monthly wage &ldquo;and all
found,&rdquo; to be paid after the proceeds of the voyage
were realized.</p>
<p>There was not a cent of Grande Mignon credit left
in the world, and there was no child too small to
realize that on the outcome of this venture hung the
fate and future of the island.</p>
<p>It was a brilliant day, with a glorious blue sky
overhead and a bracing breeze out of the east. Just
beyond Long Island a low stratum of miasmic gray
was the only shred of the usual fog to be seen on the
whole horizon. In the little roadstead the vessels,
black-hulled or white, rode eagerly and gracefully
at their moorings, the bright sun bringing out the red,
yellow, green, blue, and brown of the dories nested
amidships.</p>
<p>At seven o&rsquo;clock the steamer <i>Grande Mignon</i> blew
a great blast of her whistle, cast off her lines, and
cleared for St. Andrew&rsquo;s and St. Stephens. Tooting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
a long, last salute, she rolled out into Fundy and out
of sight around the point.</p>
<p>For these men breakfast was long past, but there
were the myriad last details that could not be left
undone; and it was fully eight o&rsquo;clock before the last
dory was swung aboard and the last barrel stowed.</p>
<p>Then there came the clicking of many windlasses
and the strain of many ropes, and to the women and
girls who lined the shore these noises were as the
beatings of the executioner&rsquo;s hand upon the cell-door
of a condemned man.</p>
<p>For the first time they seemed to realize what was
about to happen. The young girls and the brides
wept, but those with children at their skirts looked
stonily to the vessel that bore their loved ones; for
they were hardened in the fear of death and bereavement,
and had become fatalists.</p>
<p>The old women shook their heads, and if tears
rolled down their faces they were the tears of dotage,
and were shed perhaps for the swift and fleeting
beauty of brides under the strain of their first long
separation.</p>
<p>Of these last one stood apart, a shawl over her
gray hair and her hands folded as though obedient to
a will greater than her own. In all the color and
pageant of departure May Schofield wondered where
her son might be, the son whom she felt had run away
from his just responsibilities. Two nights ago he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
gone, and since that time the little cottage had seemed
worse than deserted.</p>
<p>Somehow the story of the solicitor and his visit
went swiftly around the village, and since that time
Code&rsquo;s mother had been the shrinking object of a
host of polite but evidently pointed inquiries.</p>
<p>To most of these there was really no adequate reply,
and the good woman had grown more hurt and
more shrinking with every hour of the day. Now,
with little orphan Josie at her side, she came out to
see the departure of the fleet.</p>
<p>Suddenly there came the squeaking of blocks and
the rattle and scrape of rings as foresails were rushed
up at peak and throat. Headsails raced into position,
and, with the anchors cat-headed; the vessels,
with their captains at the wheels or tillers, swung into
the wind and began to crawl ahead.</p>
<p>Behind them, as they forged toward the passage,
lay the gray scimitar of stony beach half a mile long.
Beyond it were the white, contented-looking cottages
built along the road, and back of all rose the vivid
green mountains, covered with pine, tamarack, and
silver birch, above whose tops at the line of the summit
there appeared three terrific, puffy thunder-heads.</p>
<p>As they moved toward Flag Point the gaily colored
crowds moved with them past the post-office, the
stores, the burned wharfs, and the fish stands.</p>
<p>Captain Bijonah Tanner, by right of seniority, led
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
the way in the <i>Rosan</i> as commodore of the fleet. He
stood to his tiller like a graven image, looking neither
to right nor left, but gripping his pipe with all the
strength of his remaining teeth.</p>
<p>He hoped that his triumph would not be lost upon
his wife. Nor was it, for it was a month afterward
before the neighbors ceased to hear how her Bige
was the best captain that ever sailed out of Freekirk
Head.</p>
<p>At Swallowtail Bijonah rounded the point, gave
one majestic wave of his hat in farewell, and put the
<i>Rosan</i> over on the starboard tack, for the course was
southeast, and followed practically the wake of Code
Schofield.</p>
<p>One after another the schooners and sloops, closely
bunched, came about as smartly as their crews could
bring them&ndash;&ndash;and the smartest of them all was
Nat Burns&rsquo;s <i>Nettie B.</i></p>
<p>Nellie Tanner, jealous for her father&rsquo;s prestige,
could not but admire the splendid discipline and
tactics that whipped the <i>Nettie</i> about on the tack and
sent her flying ahead of the <i>Rosan</i> like a great seabird.
Once Swallowtail was passed the voyage had
begun, and the lead belonged to any one who could
take it.</p>
<p>At last the knifelike edge of Long Island shut them
out completely, and seemed at the same instant to cut
the last bonds and ties that had stretched from one to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
another as long as vision lasted. The men felt as
released from a spell. One idea rushed into their
minds suddenly and became an obsession.</p>
<p>Fish!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>NAT BURNS SHOWS HIS HAND</h3>
</div>
<p>OFF Cape Sable the fleet was overhauled by
a half-dozen schooners bound the same way,
which displayed American flags at their
main trucks as they came up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gloucestermen!&rdquo; said Nat Burns at the wheel of
the <i>Nettie B.</i> &ldquo;Set balloon jib and stays&rsquo;l and we&rsquo;ll
give &rsquo;em a try-out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men jumped to the orders, and the <i>Nettie</i>
gathered headway as the American schooners came
up. But the Gloucester craft crept up, passed, and
with an ironical dip of their little flags raced on to the
Banks.</p>
<p>Cape Sable was not yet out of sight when a topmast
on the <i>Rosan</i> broke off short in a sudden squall.
Bijonah Tanner immediately laid her to and set all
hands to work stepping his spare spar, as he would
not think of returning to a shipyard. Nat Burns,
when he noticed the accident, laid to in turn and announced
his intention of standing by the <i>Rosan</i> until
she was ready to go on.</p>
<p>As these were among the fastest vessels in the fleet,
the others proceeded on their way, and Nat seized
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
the opportunity of the repairs to pay his <i>fianc&eacute;e</i> a visit
and remain to supper on the <i>Rosan</i>.</p>
<p>He found Nellie radiant and more beautiful than
he had ever seen her. Protected from the cool
breeze by a frieze overcoat, she stood bareheaded by
the forerigging, her cheeks red, her brown eyes bright
like stars, and her soft brown hair blowing about her
face in alluring wisps.</p>
<p>He took her in a strong embrace. She struggled
free after a moment, her cheeks flooded with color.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Nat!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Before all the men,
too! Please behave yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This last a little nervously as she saw the gleam
in his eyes. Suddenly (for her) all the day seemed
to have lost its exhilaration. She was always glad to
see Nat, but his insistent use of his <i>fianc&eacute;</i> rights under
all circumstances grated on the natural delicacy that
was hers.</p>
<p>His ardor dampened by this rebuke, the gleam in
Nat&rsquo;s eye became one of ugliness at his humiliation
before the crew of the <i>Rosan</i>. He scowled furiously
and stood by her side without saying a word. It was
in this unfortunate moment that Nellie seized on the
general topic of the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;ll have to get off and push the <i>Nettie
B.</i> before you can beat those Gloucestermen, Nat,&rdquo;
she said, teasing him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I&rsquo;ve heard about all I want to hear about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
that!&rdquo; he snarled, suddenly losing control of himself
as they walked back to the little cabin. The girl
looked at him in hurt amazement. Never in all her
life had a man spoken to her in such a tone. It was
inconceivable that the man she was going to marry
could address her so, if he even pretended to love
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly you have,&rdquo; she returned, not without a
touch of asperity; &ldquo;but you know as well as I do
that you will have to deal with a Gloucester-built
schooner before you are through with this voyage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In her efforts to placate him she had touched upon
his sorest spot. His defeat by the American fishermen
had been hard for his pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you mean that crooked Schofield&rsquo;s
boat?&rdquo; he flashed back, his face darkening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were below now in her father&rsquo;s little cabin,
and she turned upon him with flashing eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I said,&rdquo; he returned sullenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say things then that have no foundation in
fact,&rdquo; she retorted vigorously. &ldquo;You have no right
to say a thing like that about Code Schofield.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t, eh?&rdquo; he sneered, furious. &ldquo;Since
when have you been takin&rsquo; his side against me? No
facts, eh? I&rsquo;ll show him an&rsquo; you an&rsquo; everybody else
whether there&rsquo;s any foundation in fact! What do
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
you suppose the insurance company is after him for
if he isn&rsquo;t a crook?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like all the people in Freekirk Head, Nellie had
heard some of the rumors concerning Code&rsquo;s possible
part in the sinking of the <i>May Schofield</i>. Nat, for
reasons of his own, had carefully refrained from enlarging
on these to her, and in the absorption of her
wooing by him she had let them go by unnoticed.
Now, for the first time, the consequences they might
have in Code&rsquo;s life were made clear to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she faltered, unable to reply
to his direct question. &ldquo;But I know this, that all
his life Code has been an honest man and one of my
best friends. I grew up with him just as I did with
you, and I resent such talk about him as much as I
would if it were about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he sneered, &ldquo;he has been entirely too much
of a good friend. What was he always over to your
place for, I&rsquo;d like to know? And, even after he
knew we were engaged, what was he doin&rsquo; down at
Ma Sprague&rsquo;s that night I called? An&rsquo; what did you
go to his place for after the fire when I tried to get
you to come to mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last question he roared out at the top of his
voice, and the girl, now afraid of him, shrank back
against the wall of the cabin.</p>
<p>She knew it was useless to say that she and Code
had been like brother and sister all their lives, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
that May Schofield was a second mother to her. All
reason was hopeless in the face of this unreasoning
jealousy. After a moment she found her speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess, Nat,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you had better go back
to your schooner until you are in a different mood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid to answer, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;When I face you down you&rsquo;re afraid to answer an&rsquo;
tell me I&rsquo;d better go away. Well, now let me tell
<i>you</i> something. You&rsquo;re entirely too friendly with
that crook, an&rsquo; I won&rsquo;t have it! You&rsquo;re engaged to
me, and what I say goes. An&rsquo; let me tell you something
else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The insurance company is after him because he
sunk the <i>May Schofield</i> on purpose. But that ain&rsquo;t
the worst of the things he did&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she flashed at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find out quick enough, and so will he,&rdquo; he
snarled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying what is goin&rsquo; to happen
to him, but when I&rsquo;m through we&rsquo;ll see if your hero
is such a fine specimen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From fear to anger her spirit had gone, and now
under the lash it turned to cold disdain. With a
swift motion of her right hand over her left she drew
off the diamond ring he had given her and held it
out to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take this, Nat,&rdquo; she said, so coldly that for once
his rage was checked. He looked stupidly at the glittering
emblem of her love, and suddenly became
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
aware of the extent to which he had driven her.
The reaction was as swift as the rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, Nellie dear,&rdquo; he begged, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t do that!
Take it back. Forgive me. Everything has piled
up so to-day that I lost my temper. Please don&rsquo;t do
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he had gone too far. He had shown her a
new side to his character.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Nat,&rdquo; she said calmly, but still with that icy
inflection of disdain; &ldquo;this has gone too far. Take
this ring. Some time, when you have made amends
for this afternoon, I may see you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t take it,&rdquo; he replied doggedly. &ldquo;Please,
Nellie, forgive&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it,&rdquo; she flashed, &ldquo;or I will throw it into
the ocean!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had unconsciously submitted him to a final test.
He was about to let her carry out her threat if she
saw fit when his cupidity overcame him. He reached
out his hand, and she dropped the ring into it. She
stood silent, pale, and cold, waiting for him to
go.</p>
<p>He moved away. He had reached the foot of the
companionway when he turned back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has brought me to this,&rdquo; he said so slowly
and evilly that each word seemed a drop of venom.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll make him pay. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to St. John&rsquo;s, and
when I get back it will be the sorriest day in his life
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
and yours, too. His life won&rsquo;t be worth the thread
it hangs on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he went up the companionway and, not
noticing the greeting of Captain Tanner, dropped
into his yellow dory that swung and bumped against
the <i>Rosan&rsquo;s</i> side. Swiftly he rowed to the <i>Nettie B.</i>
and clambered aboard, bellowing orders to get up
sail. In fifteen minutes the schooner was on the back
track under every stitch of canvas she carried.</p>
<p>Bijonah Tanner stared blankly after the retreating
<i>Nettie</i>. Then, knowing that his daughter had been
with Nat, dropped down into the little cabin.</p>
<p>He found Nellie seated in the chair by the little
table, and weeping.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XIV_A_DISCOVERY' id='CHAPTER_XIV_A_DISCOVERY'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>A DISCOVERY</h3>
</div>
<p>Taken aback as he had been by the strange
doings of Nat&rsquo;s schooner, his dismay then
was a feeble imitation of the panic that
smote him now. It had long been a favorite formula
of Bijonah&rsquo;s that &ldquo;A schooner&rsquo;s a gal you can understand.
She goes where ye send her, an&rsquo; ye know
she&rsquo;ll come back when ye tell her to. She&rsquo;s a snug,
trustin&rsquo; kind of critter, an&rsquo; she&rsquo;s man&rsquo;s best friend because
she hain&rsquo;t got a grain o&rsquo; sense. But woman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Bijonah always ended, his hands, his voice,
and his sentence suspended in mid air.</p>
<p>Now he was baffled completely. Here was a girl
who was deeply in love, crying. He tiptoed cautiously
to the deck again and stole forward to the galley
as though he had been detected in a suspicious
action.</p>
<p>After a while the storm passed, and Nellie sat up,
red-eyed and red-nosed, but with a measure of her
usual tranquillity restored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Idiot!&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;To howl like that
over <i>him</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></div>
<p>Nellie finally regained her poise of mind and remembered
that she had been at the point of writing a
letter to her mother (to be mailed by the first vessel
bound to a port) when Nat had interrupted her.</p>
<p>The table at which she sat was a rough, square one
of oak, with one drawer that extended its whole
width. She opened the drawer and found it stuffed
with an untidy mass of paper, envelopes, newspapers,
clippings, books, ink, and a mucilage-pot that had
foundered in the last gale and spread its contents over
everything.</p>
<p>Such was her struggle to find two clean sheets of
paper and a pen that she finally dumped the contents
of the drawer on top of the table and went to the
task seriously. The very first thing that came under
her hand was a heavy packet.</p>
<p>Turning it face up, she read, with surprise, a large
feminine handwriting which said:</p>
<p class='center'>Mr. Code Schofield, kindness of Captain B. Tanner<br />
<br />
Letter enclosed.</p>
<p>At the right-hand side of the envelope was this:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>5&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;10s<br />
10&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;5s<br />
50&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;1s<br />
&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;<br />
$150</p>
</td></tr></table>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></div>
<p>Nellie Tanner stared at the envelope. It was the
handwriting that held her. She had seen it before.
She had once been honorary assistant treasurer of the
Church of England chapel, and it suddenly came to
her that this was the handwriting that had adorned
Elsa Mallaby&rsquo;s checks and subscriptions.</p>
<p>She knew she had solved the problem the instant
the answer came. Elsa had been to Boston to
school, and the fact was very evident. She sat and
stared at the black letters, flexing the packet filled
with bills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should Elsa Mallaby be sending money to
Code Schofield?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody in Freekirk Head knew that Code
Schofield went up to Elsa Mallaby&rsquo;s to dinner occasionally.
So did other people in the village, but
not so often as he. There had been a little gossip
concerning the two of them, but, while Code was an
excellent enough fellow, it was hardly probable that
a rich widow like Elsa would throw herself away on a
poor <i>fisherman</i>. They <i>forgot</i> that she had done so
the first time she married, and that she had the sea
in her blood.</p>
<p>These shreds of gossip returned to Nellie now with
accrued interest, and she began to believe in the
theory of fire being behind smoke.</p>
<p>She also remembered the night of the mass-meeting
in Odd Fellows Hall when Code had made his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
suggestion of going to the Banks. There had
flashed between Elsa&rsquo;s velvet-dark eyes and Code&rsquo;s
blue ones a message of intimacy of which the town
knew nothing. Every one saw the look, and nearly
every one talked about it, but they did not know that
only a couple of nights before Elsa had been the one
to put Code on guard against his enemies, and that
he was more than grateful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d just like to know what&rsquo;s in that letter so as to
tease him the next time we meet,&rdquo; she said gaily to
herself. She was now out of all mood for writing
her letter home, and, stuffing the contents of the
drawer back into place, she returned the latter to the
table and went on deck.</p>
<p>The sea was running higher. The new topmast
was up, and within half an hour the <i>Rosan</i> heeled to
the wind and plowed her way northward after the
remainder of the fleet.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>THE CATCH OF THE ROSAN</h3>
</div>
<p>At the forecastle head of the <i>Rosan</i> stood a
youth tolling the ship&rsquo;s bell. The windlass
grunted and whined as the schooner
came up on her hawser with a thump, and overhead a
useless jib slatted and rattled.</p>
<p>The youth could scarcely see aft of the foremast
because of the thickness of the weather, but he could
hear what was going on. There was a thump, a
slimy slapping of wet fish, and a voice counting monotonously
as its owner forked his forenoon&rsquo;s catch
into the pen amidships.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forty-nine,&rdquo; said the voice. &ldquo;All right, boys,
swing her in.&rdquo; And a moment later the dory, hauled
high, dropped down into her nest. Immediately
there was a slight bump against the side of the
schooner, and the slapping and counting would begin
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eighty-seven, and high line at that!&rdquo; said the
next man. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet that&rsquo;s the only halibut on the
Banks, and he&rsquo;s two hundred if he&rsquo;s an ounce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great, flat fish was raised to the deck by means
of the topping haul that swung in the dories.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></div>
<p>Bijonah Tanner, who stood by the pen watching
the silver stream as it flowed over the side into the
pen, mussed his beard and shook his head. The fish
were fair, but not what should be expected at this time
of year. He would sail along to another favorable
anchorage. This was his first day on the Banks and
two days after Nellie&rsquo;s discovery of Elsa&rsquo;s packet.</p>
<p>It was only noon, but Bijonah was speculating, and
when he saw the fog bank coming he refused to run
any risk with his men, and recalled them to the
schooner by firing his shotgun until they all replied
to the signal by raising one oar upright.</p>
<p>It must not be thought that it was the fog that induced
Bijonah to do this. Dorymen almost always
fish when a fog comes down, and trust to their good
fortune in finding the schooner. Bijonah wanted to
look over the morning&rsquo;s catch and get in tune with
the millions under his keel.</p>
<p>By the time the last dory was in, the pile of fish
in the pen looked like a heap of molten silver.</p>
<p>The men stretched themselves after their cramped
quarters, and greeted the cook&rsquo;s announcement with
delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fellers fix tables fer dressin&rsquo; down while the
fust half mugs up,&rdquo; said Tanner. &ldquo;Everybody
lively now. I cal&rsquo;late to move just a little bit. The
bottom here don&rsquo;t suit me yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went down from the poop and walked the deck,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
listening between clangings of the bell for any sound
of an approaching vessel. The crew worked swiftly
at dressing and salting the catch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haul up anchor,&rdquo; he ordered when the work was
done.</p>
<p>The watch laid hold the windlass poles and hauled
the vessel forward directly above her hook. Then
there was a concerted heave and the ground tackle
broke loose and came up with a rush.</p>
<p>Under headsails and riding sail the <i>Rosan</i> swung
into the light air that stirred the fog and began to
crawl forward while the men were still cat-heading
the anchor. The youth who had been ringing the
bell now substituted the patent fog-horn, as marine
law requires when vessels are under way.</p>
<p>With his eyes on the compass, Turner guided the
ship himself. They seemed to move through an endless
gray world.</p>
<p>For an hour they sailed, the only sounds being the
flap of the canvas, the creaking of the tiller ropes, and
the drip of the fog. Tanner was about to give the
word to let go the anchor when, without warning,
they suddenly burst clear of the fog and came out into
the vast gray welter of the open sea.</p>
<p>Tanner suddenly straightened up, and slipping the
wheel swiftly into the becket, he ran to the taffrail
and looked over the side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></div>
<p>Not fifty feet away lay a blue dory, heavy and
loggy with water, and in the bottom the unconscious
figure of a man.</p>
<p>A second look at the face of the man and Tanner
cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wheelan and Markle, overside with the starboard
dory. Here&rsquo;s Code Schofield adrift! Lively
now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a rush aft, but Tanner met the crew
and drove them to the nested boats amidships.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over, I say!&rdquo; he roared.</p>
<p>The men obeyed him, and Wheelan and Markle
were soon pulling madly to the blue dory astern.</p>
<p>When they reached it one man clambered to the
bow and cut the drag rope that Code, in his extremity,
had thrown over nearly two days before.
Then, fastening the short painter to a thwart in their
own craft, they hauled the blue dory and its contents
alongside the <i>Rosan</i>.</p>
<p>Code Schofield lay with his eyes closed, pale as
wax, and seemingly dead. In his right hand he still
gripped convulsively the bailing-can he had used until
consciousness left him.</p>
<p>Man, boat, and all, the dory was hauled up and
let gently down on the deck. Then the eager hands
lifted Schofield from the water and laid him on the
oiled boards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take him into my cabin,&rdquo; ordered Tanner.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
&ldquo;Johnson, bring hot water and rags. Cookee,
make some strong soup. If there&rsquo;s any life in him
we&rsquo;ll bring it back. On the jump, there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; said one man, when Code had been carried
below, &ldquo;I thought my halibut was high line to-day,
but the skipper beat me out in the end.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>A STAGGERING BLOW</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here is something my father just asked
me to give you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nellie held out to Code the packet that
she had discovered in the skipper&rsquo;s drawer several
days before. Code, seated on the roof of the cabin
in the only loose chair aboard the <i>Rosan</i>, and
wrapped in blankets, took the sealed bundle curiously.</p>
<p>He looked at the round, feminine handwriting
across the envelope, and failed to evince any flash of
guilt or intelligence.</p>
<p>It was three days after Code&rsquo;s rescue by the <i>Rosan</i>
and the first that he had felt any of his old strength
coming back to him.</p>
<p>For the first twenty-four hours after being revived
he did nothing but sleep, and awoke to find Nellie
Tanner beside his bunk nursing him. Since then it
had been merely a matter of patience until his exhausted
body had recuperated from the shock.</p>
<p>For once Nellie had command of the <i>Rosan</i>, and
everything stood aside for her patient. The delicacies
that issued from the galley after she had occupied
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
it an hour, and that went directly to Code, almost
had the result of inciting a mutiny among all
hands; terms of settlement being the retirement of
the old cook and installation of this new find.</p>
<p>Code ripped open the packet. He stared in
amazement at the yellow bills. Then he discovered
the letter and began to read it. Despite the healthy
red of his weather-beaten face, a tide of color surged
up over it.</p>
<p>Nellie turned her head away and looked over the
oily gray sea to where the men of the <i>Rosan</i> were
toiling in their dories. In the distance there was a
sail here and there, for the <i>Rosan</i> was slowly overhauling
the fleet from Freekirk Head.</p>
<p>Code stole a swift glance at her, and forgot to read
his letter as he studied the fresh roundness and beauty
of her face. He vaguely felt that there was a reserved
manner between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The letter is from Mrs. Mallaby,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes? That is interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s cool, level eyes met his, and he blushed
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has a good heart,&rdquo; he stumbled on, &ldquo;and always
thinks of others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she has,&rdquo; agreed the girl without enthusiasm,
and Code dropped the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did your father happen to have this for
me?&rdquo; he asked, after a pause.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know, you surprised everybody by
leaving the Head before the rest of the fleet. Elsa
had it in mind to give you this packet, she <i>says</i>, before
you left. But when you went so suddenly she asked
father to give it to you. She said she expected the
<i>Rosan</i> would catch the <i>Lass</i> on the Banks. At least,
this is the yarn dad told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She seems to know considerable about the Banks
and the ways of fishermen,&rdquo; he said, with an unconscious
ring of enthusiasm in his tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; you&rsquo;d think she pulled her own dory instead
of being the richest woman in New Brunswick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Code looked at his old sweetheart in amazement.
He had never seen her so disagreeable. His eye fell
upon her left hand.</p>
<p>For a moment his mind did not register an impression.
Then all of a sudden it flashed upon him that
her ring was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>that</i> explains everything!&rdquo; he said to himself.
&ldquo;She has either lost it or quarreled with Nat,
and it&rsquo;s no wonder she is unhappy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nellie was saying to herself: &ldquo;The letter must
have been very personal or he would have told me
about it. He never acted like this before. There
<i>is</i> something between them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly astern of them sounded the flap of sails,
rattle of blocks, and shouted orders. They turned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
in time to see a schooner come up into the wind all
standing.</p>
<p>She was clothed in canvas from head to foot, with
a balloon-jib and staysail added, and made her position
less than a hundred yards away.</p>
<p>Schofield gazed at the schooner curiously. Then
he leaned forward, his eyes alight. There were certain
points about her that were familiar. With a
fisherman&rsquo;s skill he had catalogued her every point.
He looked at the trail-board along her bows, and
where the name should have been there was a blank,
painted-out space.</p>
<p>It was the mystery schooner!</p>
<p>Once more all the fears that had assailed Code&rsquo;s
mind at her first appearance returned. He was certain
that there was mischief in this. But he sat quiet
as the vessel drifted down upon the anchored
<i>Rosan</i>.</p>
<p>As he looked her over his eyes were drawn aloft
to a series of wires strung between her topmasts.
Other wires ran down the foremast to a little cubby
just aft of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the great squid, they&rsquo;ve got wireless!&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;This beats me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At fifty yards the familiar man with the enormous
megaphone made his appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahoy there!&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;Any one aboard
the <i>Rosan</i> seen or heard anything of Captain Code
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
Schofield, of the Grande Mignon schooner <i>Charming
Lass?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Code rose out of his chair, took off his hat ironically,
and swung it before him as he made a low
bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At your service!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;I was picked
up three days ago, adrift in my dory. What do you
want with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This sudden avowal created a half panic aboard
the mysterious schooner, and the man astern exchanged
his megaphone for field-glasses. After a
long scrutiny he went back to the megaphone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Congratulations, captain!&rdquo; came the bellow.
&ldquo;When are you going to rejoin the <i>Lass?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon the <i>Rosan</i> catches her,&rdquo; replied Code,
and then, exasperated by the unexpected maneuvers
of this remarkable vessel, he cried: &ldquo;Who are you
and what do you want that you chase me all over the
sea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly the man put down the megaphone and
gave orders to the crew, and in five minutes she was
on her way north into the very heart of the fleet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who she is or why she is or who is
aboard her,&rdquo; he told Nellie, after recounting to her
the previous visitation of the schooner. &ldquo;She reminds
me of a nervous old hen keeping track of a
stray chick. Pretty soon I won&rsquo;t be able to curse
the weather without being afraid my guardian will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
hear me. I say guardian, and yet I don&rsquo;t know
whether she is friendly or merely fixing up some calamity
to break all at once. You know I have enemies.
She may be working for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl could offer no solution, nor could Bijonah
Tanner, who had witnessed the incident from
the forecastle head where he was smoking and anticipating
the wishes of the cod beneath him. He
had walked aft, and the three discussed the mystery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever see her before, captain?&rdquo; asked Code.</p>
<p>If there was any man who knew schooners that
had fished the Banks or the Bay of Fundy, it was
Bijonah Tanner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cal&rsquo;late I ever did. I&rsquo;ve never saw <i>jest</i>
that set to a foregaff nor <i>jest</i> that cut of a jumbo-jib
afore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tanner watched the schooner as she scudded away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mighty big hurry, I allow,&rdquo; he remarked.
&ldquo;But, Jiminy, doesn&rsquo;t she sail! There ain&rsquo;t hardly
an air o&rsquo; wind stirrin&rsquo; and yet look at her go! She&rsquo;s
a mighty-able vessel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was about four o&rsquo;clock the next afternoon that
the <i>Rosan</i> crept up in the middle of the fishing fleet.
She had made a long berth overnight, dressed an excellent
morning&rsquo;s catch, and knocked off half a day
because Bijonah did not feel it right to keep Code
longer away from his vessel.</p>
<p>And Tanner managed the thing with a good eye
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
to the dramatic. When he reached the rear guard
of the fleet he began to work his vessel gracefully
in and out among the sloops and schooners.</p>
<p>Code, seated in his chair on the cabin roof, did
not realize what was going on until the triumphal
procession was well under way.</p>
<p>Through the fleet they went&ndash;&ndash;a fleet that was
wearing crape for him&ndash;&ndash;and from every vessel received
a volley of cheers.</p>
<p>The <i>Charming Lass</i> greeted him with open arms.
Pete Ellinwood swung him up from the transferring
dory with a great bellow of delight, and he was
passed along the line until, battered, joyous, and
radiant, he arrived exhausted by the wheel, where he
sat down.</p>
<p>When they all had drunk to the reunion from a
rare old bottle, heavily cobwebbed, Code told his
story. Then, while the men dressed down, he
walked about, looking things over and counting the
crew on his fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pete!&rdquo; he called suddenly, and the mate left the
fish-pen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Arry Duncan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, skipper, I didn&rsquo;t want to tell you fer fear
you had enough on yer mind already, but Arry never
come back the same day you was lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God! Another one! I wondered how
many would get caught that day!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; that ain&rsquo;t all. He had your motor-dory
with him&ndash;&ndash;the one you caught us with out of Castalia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did he have that? I gave orders the motor-dories
weren&rsquo;t to be used.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, cookee an&rsquo; the boy&ndash;&ndash;they was the only
ones aboard&ndash;&ndash;tell it this way: Arry he struck a
heavy school fust time he lets his dory rodin&rsquo; go,
an&rsquo; most of his fish topped forty pound. In an hour
his dory was full, and it was a three-mile pull back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he got in he argued them others into
givin&rsquo; him the motor-dory, &rsquo;cause it holds so much
more. They helped him swing it over, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s
the last they see of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, if he had an engine, you&rsquo;d think he could&rsquo;ve
made it back here or run foul of somebody or somethin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yas, you would think so; but he didn&rsquo;t, the more
peace to him,&rdquo; was Ellinwood&rsquo;s reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poor feller!&rdquo; said Code. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for
his wife. Anything else happen while I was gone,
Pete?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, let me think!&rdquo; The mate scratched his
head. &ldquo;Oh, yes! Curse me, I nearly forgot it!
You know that quair schooner that chased us down
one day an&rsquo; asked the fool questions about you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I saw that same schooner again yesterday.
She asked more fool questions.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You did!&rdquo; cried Ellinwood in amazement. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t see her, but I heard her, an&rsquo; I got a message
from her for you. It was night when they come up
on us an&rsquo; hailed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They said they had news of you, an&rsquo; would we
send a dory over. Would we? They was about
six over in as many minutes. But they wouldn&rsquo;t let
us aboard. No, sir; kept us off with poles an&rsquo; asked
for me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I got in clost they told me the <i>Rosan</i> had
found you, and handed me an envelope with a message
inside of it. Just as I was goin&rsquo; away there
came the most awful clickin&rsquo; an&rsquo; flashin&rsquo; amidships I
ever saw&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wireless,&rdquo; said Code.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, I&rsquo;ve heard of it, but I never see it before;
an&rsquo; I come away as quick as I could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the message?&rdquo; asked Code curiously.</p>
<p>Pete laboriously unpinned a waistcoat-pocket and
produced an envelope which he handed to Code. It
was sealed, and the skipper tore away the end. The
mystery and interest of the thing played upon his
mind until he was in a tremble of nervous excitement.</p>
<p>At last he would know what the schooner was and
why.</p>
<p>Eagerly he opened the message. It was typewritten
on absolutely plain paper and unsigned,
further baffling his curiosity.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
After a moment he read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class='smcap'>Captain Schofield</span>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday at St. Andrew&rsquo;s suit was filed
against you for murder in the first degree upon
the person of Michael Burns, late of Freekirk
Head, Grande Mignon Island. Plaintiff, Nathaniel
Burns, son of the deceased. There is an order
out for your arrest. This is a friendly warning
and no more. You are now fore-armed!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>TRAWLERS</h3>
</div>
<p>Schofield stood as one stupefied, staring
blankly at the fateful words.</p>
<p>Murder in the first degree!</p>
<p>Had it not been for his thorough knowledge of
Nat Burns&rsquo;s character he would have laughed at
the absurdity of the thing and thrown the message
over the side.</p>
<p>But now he remained like one fast in the clutch of
some horrible nightmare, unable to reason, unable to
think coherently, unable to do anything but attempt
to sound the depths of a hatred such as this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, what is it, skipper?&rdquo; asked
Ellinwood.</p>
<p>Code passed the message to his mate without a
word. His men might as well know the worst at
once. Ellinwood read slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rot!&rdquo; he snarled in his great rumbling voice.
&ldquo;Murder? How does he get murder out of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I sank the old <i>May Schofield</i> for her insurance
money, which is what every one believes, then
I deliberately caused the death of the men with me,
didn&rsquo;t I? Pete, this is a pretty-serious thing. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
didn&rsquo;t care when they set the insurance company on
me, but this is different. If it goes beyond this
stage I will carry the disgrace of jail and a trial all
my life. That devil has nearly finished me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Code&rsquo;s voice broke, and the tears of helpless rage
smarted in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady on, now!&rdquo; counseled Pete, looking with
pity at the young skipper he worshiped. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
done fer you true this time, but the end of things is
a tarnal long ways off yet, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t you go losin&rsquo;
yer spunk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what have I ever done to him that he should
start this against me?&rdquo; cried Schofield.</p>
<p>Pete could not answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do they do when a man is accused of murder?&rdquo;
asked Code.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, arrest him, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pete scratched his chin reminiscently. &ldquo;There
was that Bulwer case.&rdquo; He recounted it in detail.
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;they can&rsquo;t do nothin&rsquo; until the
man accused is arrested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After that he gets a preliminary hearin&rsquo;, and, if
things seem plain enough, then the grand jury indicts
him. After that he&rsquo;s tried by a reg&rsquo;lar jury. So
the fust thing they&rsquo;ve got to do is arrest you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darn it, they sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll sail to Africa first!&rdquo;
snarled Code, his eyes blazing. He strode up and
down the deck.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You say the word, skipper,&rdquo; rumbled Pete loyally,
&ldquo;an&rsquo; we crack on every stitch fer the north
pole!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Code smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curse me if I don&rsquo;t like to see a man smile when
he&rsquo;s in trouble,&rdquo; announced Pete roundly. &ldquo;Skipper,
you&rsquo;ll do. You&rsquo;re young, an&rsquo; these things come
hard, but I cal&rsquo;late we&rsquo;ll drop all this talk about
sailin&rsquo; away to furrin parts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, there&rsquo;s jest two courses left fer you to sail.
Either we go on fishin&rsquo; an&rsquo; dodge the gunboat that
brings the officer after you, or we go on fishin&rsquo; an&rsquo;
let him get you when he comes. I&rsquo;ll stand by you
either way. You&rsquo;ve got yer mother to support, God
bless her! An&rsquo; you&rsquo;ve got a right to fill yer
hold with fish so&rsquo;s she can live when they&rsquo;re sold.
That&rsquo;s one way of lookin&rsquo; at it; the other&rsquo;s plain
sailin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Pete; this is too serious. I guess the
mother&rsquo;ll have to suffer this time, too. If they send
a man after me I&rsquo;ll be here and I&rsquo;ll go back and
take my medicine. I&rsquo;ll make you skipper, and you
can select your mate. You&rsquo;ll get a skipper&rsquo;s share,
and you can pay mother the regular amount for hiring
the <i>Lass</i>&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll get skipper&rsquo;s share if I have to lick every
hand aboard!&rdquo; growled Ellinwood. &ldquo;An&rsquo; you can
rest easy on that.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; said Code gently; &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t
know what I&rsquo;d do without you, Pete.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t supposed to do without me. What in
thunder do you suppose I shipped with you fer if it
wasn&rsquo;t to look after you, hey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men had finished dressing down and were
cleaning up the decks. Several of them, noticing
that something momentous was being discussed, were
edging nearer. Pete observed this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Skipper,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got four or five shots
of trawl-line to pick. Suppose you and I go out an&rsquo;
do the job? Then we can talk in peace. Feel
able?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never better in my life. Get my dory over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That blue one? Never again! That&rsquo;s bad
luck fer you. Take mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Anything you say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several hands made the dory ready. Into it they
put three or four tubs or half casks in which was
coiled hundreds of fathoms of stout line furnished
with a strong hook every two or three feet. Each
hook was baited with a fat salt clam, for the early
catch of squid had been exhausted by the dory fishing.
There was also a fresh tub of bait, buoys, and
a lantern.</p>
<p>A youth aboard clambered up to the cross-trees,
gave them the direction of the trawl buoy-light, and
they started. It was a clear, starlit night with only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
a gentle sea running and no wind to speak of. There
was not a hint of fog.</p>
<p>The <i>Charming Lass</i> lay now in the Atlantic approximately
along the forty-sixth parallel, near its
intersection with the fifty-fifth of meridian; or
eighty to a hundred miles southwest of Cape Race,
Newfoundland, and almost an equal distance southeast
of the Miquelon Islands, France&rsquo;s sole remaining
territorial possession in the New World.</p>
<p>Code and Ellinwood easily found their trawl buoy
by the glimmer of the light across the water. They
immediately began to plant the trawl-lines in the
tubs aboard the dory. The big buoy for the end
of the line they first anchored to the bottom with
dory roding.</p>
<p>Then, as Ellinwood rowed slowly, Code paid the
baited trawl-line out of the tubs. As there are
hooks every few feet, so are there big wooden buoys,
so that the whole length of the line&ndash;&ndash;sometimes
twenty-five hundred feet&ndash;&ndash;is floated near the surface.</p>
<p>When the last had been paid out, a second anchor
and large buoy was fixed, and their trawl was
&ldquo;set.&rdquo; Next they turned their attention to picking
the trawl already in the water.</p>
<p>As the line came over the starboard gunnel Code
picked the fish off the hooks, passing the hooks to
Pete, who baited them and threw them over the port
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
gunnel. Thus they would work their way along the
whole of the line.</p>
<p>Many of the hooks that came to Code&rsquo;s hands still
had the bait with which they were set.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be in the bait,&rdquo; he told Ellinwood. &ldquo;The
fish wouldn&rsquo;t touch it. This is no catch for five shots
of trawl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Pete could not cast any light on the subject.</p>
<p>It was certainly true that the catch from the trawl-line
was small enough to be remarkable, but the men
were helpless to explain the reason.</p>
<p>For two hours they worked along the great line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a bare chance that the message from
the unknown schooner might be a fake, although I
can&rsquo;t imagine why,&rdquo; said Code as they were returning.
&ldquo;But if it is not, and the Canadian gunboat
comes after me, she&rsquo;ll find me here, willing to go
back to St. Andrew&rsquo;s and answer all charges. No
escape and no dodging this time! And let me tell
you something, Pete. If nothing comes out of this
except ugly rumor that I have to suffer for, I&rsquo;m
going to quit minding my own business; and I&rsquo;ll dig
up something that will drive Nat Burns out of Freekirk
Head forever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man of his character and nature has certainly
got something he doesn&rsquo;t want known, and
I shall bring it to light and make it so public that
he&rsquo;ll wish he had never heard the name Schofield.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
By Heaven, I&rsquo;ve reached the end of my patience!&rdquo;</p>
<p>If there was anything Pete Ellinwood loved it
was a fight, and at this declaration of war he roared
encouragement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do, skipper&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;ll do! Get after
him! Climb his frame! Put him out of business.
An&rsquo; let me help you. That&rsquo;s all I want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything in good time, Pete,&rdquo; grinned Code.
&ldquo;First we&rsquo;ve got to find out how much of this is in
the wind and how much is not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arrived at the schooner, they pitched their fish
into the pen for the first watch to dress and rolled
aft for the night. Code took off his coat and drew
forth the packet that Elsa had given him, looked at
it for a moment, and threw it upon the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why in time did she send me that?&rdquo; he asked
himself, his voice very near disgust. &ldquo;It must have
looked mighty strange to Nell for me to be getting
money from Elsa Mallaby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped short in the midst of pulling off one
boot. The idea had never struck him forcibly before.
Now it seemed evident that Nellie&rsquo;s reserve
might have been due to the letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a fool I was not to tell her all about it!&rdquo;
he cried. With one boot off he reached across to
the packet under the swinging lamp and drew the
letter out of it and read:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></div>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class='smcap'>Dear Partner</span>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is something that Captain Bijonah will
hand to you when he catches the <i>Lass</i>. There
are supposed to be one hundred and fifty dollars
in this packet (I never was much of a counter, as
you know). Now, dear friend, this isn&rsquo;t all for
you unless you need it. It is simply a small reserve
fund for the men of the fleet if they should
need anything&ndash;&ndash;a new gaff, for instance, or a
jib, or grub.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t much, but you never can tell when it
might come in handy. It was your good scheme
that sent the men off fishing, and you left the way
open for me to do my little part here at the Head.
Now I want to do just this much more for the sailors
of the fleet, and I am asking you to be my
treasurer. When you hear of a needy case just
give him what you think he needs and say it is a
loan from me if he won&rsquo;t take a gift.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this is a trouble to you I am sorry, but we
are all working for the good name and good times
of Grande Mignon, and I hope you won&rsquo;t mind.
Good fishing to the <i>Charming Lass</i>, high line and
topping full! May you wet your salt early and
come home again to those who are longing to see
you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is all done on the spur of the moment, so
I have no time to ask your mother to enclose a
line. But I know she sends her love. It has
been a little hard for her here since you left, bless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
her heart; but she has been as brave as a soldier
and helped me very much. We see a great deal
of each other and you can rest assured I shall
look after her.</p>
<p class='ralign'>&ldquo;Always your old friend,<span class='rindent8'>&nbsp;</span><br />
&ldquo;ELSA.&rdquo;<span class='rindent2'>&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Code read the last paragraph his eyes softened.
It was <i>white</i> of Elsa to look after his mother,
particularly now when there would be much for her
to face regarding himself. And it <i>was</i> white of her
to send the money for the sailors of the fleet. Even
she did not know, as Code did, how nearly destitute
some of the dorymen were. He would be glad
to do what little work there might be in disbursing
the sum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry Nellie didn&rsquo;t seem interested when I began
to talk about Elsa,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;I
suppose I should have told her, anyway, so there
wouldn&rsquo;t be any misunderstanding. Well, I&rsquo;ll do
it next time.&rdquo; He turned the lamp low and rolled
into his bunk.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>TREACHERY</h3>
</div>
<p>Next morning at breakfast, about four
o&rsquo;clock, Code told his crew the situation.
He knew his men thoroughly and had been
friends with most of them all his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s likely to be trouble, and I may be taken
away, but if that happens Pete will tell you what to
do. Don&rsquo;t sight Swallowtail until your salt is all
wet. Bring home a topping load and you&rsquo;ll share
topping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Code did not go out that morning. Instead, he
tried to shake off his troubles long enough to study
the fish&ndash;&ndash;which was his job on the <i>Charming Lass</i>.</p>
<p>While not a Bijonah Tanner, Code bade fair to
be his equal at Bijonah&rsquo;s age. He came of a father
with an instinct for fish, and he had inherited that
instinct fully. Under Jasper he had learned much,
but it was another matter to have some one on hand
to read the signs rather than being cast upon his own
resources.</p>
<p>The fish, from the trawl-line and Pete&rsquo;s reports of
dory work, had been running rather big. This
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
pleased him, but he knew it could not last; and he
sat with his old chart spread out before him on
the deck&ndash;&ndash;a chart edged with his father&rsquo;s valuable
penciled notes.</p>
<p>Suddenly, while in the almost subconscious state
that he achieved when very &ldquo;fishy,&rdquo; the persistent
voice of the cook broke through the wall of unconsciousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smoke on the port quarter, skipper! Smoke on
the port quarter, skipper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The phrase came with persistent repetition until
Code was fully alive to its meaning and glanced over
his left shoulder.</p>
<p>Above the line of dark blue that was the ocean,
and in the light blue that was the sky, was etched a
tree-shaped brown smudge.</p>
<p>Steamer smudges were not an unusual sight, for
not fifty miles east was the northern track of the
great ocean steamers&ndash;&ndash;a track which they were
gradually approaching as they made their berths.
But a steamer smudge over the port quarter, with
the <i>Lass&rsquo;s</i> bow headed due north, was an entirely
different thing.</p>
<p>Code went below and brought up an ancient firearm.
This he discharged while the cook ran a
trawl-tub to the truck. It was the prearranged signal
for Pete Ellinwood to come in.</p>
<p>As Code waited he had no doubt that smoke was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
from a revenue cutter or cruiser from Halifax with
his arrest warrant.</p>
<p>There was a stiff westerly breeze, and Code, glancing
up at the cloud formations, saw that there would
be a beautiful racing half-gale on by noon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a chance to run for it!&rdquo; he thought, but
resolutely put the idea from his mind.</p>
<p>Pete came in with a scowl on his face, cursing
everything under the sun, and especially a fisherman&rsquo;s
life. When told of the smoke smudge he
evinced comparatively little interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find out what she is when she gets here.
What I&rsquo;d like to know is, what&rsquo;s the matter with our
bait?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bait gone wrong again?&rdquo; asked Code anxiously,
his brows knitting. &ldquo;That stuff on the trawl wasn&rsquo;t
the only bad bait, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Everybody&rsquo;s complainin&rsquo; this mornin&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not only can&rsquo;t catch fish, but ye can&rsquo;t hardly
string the stuff on the hooks. An&rsquo; that ain&rsquo;t all. It
has a funny smell that I never found in any other
clam bait I ever used.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter with your hands,
Pete?&rdquo; cried Code, pointing. Ellinwood had removed
his nippers, and the skin of his fingers and
palms was a queer white and beginning to shred off
as if immersed long in hot water.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;By the Great Seine!&rdquo; rumbled the mate, looking
at his hands in consternation.</p>
<p>Code made a trumpet of his hands. &ldquo;Here,
cookee, roll up a tub of that bait lively. I want to
look at it. And fetch the hammer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A suspicion based upon a long-forgotten fact had
suddenly leaped into his mind.</p>
<p>When the cook hove the tub of bait on deck Code
knocked off the top boards with the hammer and
dipped up a handful of the clams. Instead of the
firm, fat shellfish that should have been in the clean
brine, he found them loose and rotten. This time
he himself detected a faint acrid odor quite different
from the usual clean, salty smell. Again he dipped
to make sure the whole tub was ruined. Then he
looked at Ellinwood in despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s acid, Pete,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My father told me
about this sort of thing being done sometimes in a
close race among bankers for the last load of fish.
If they&rsquo;re all like this we&rsquo;re done for until we can
get more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellinwood looked at him in amazement, his jaw
sagging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, who in thunder would do this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Code laughed bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one man I can think of, and that
is the fellow who got my motor-dory under false
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
pretenses. You remember how he made the cook
and the boy help him get it over the side? Well,
her gasoline-tank was full and her batteries new.
She was ready to go two hundred miles on a minute&rsquo;s
notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should he do that&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, think, Pete, <i>think!</i> Don&rsquo;t you remember?
He&rsquo;s one of the men I went up to Castalia to get,
the time that lawyer came to Freekirk Head. And
he&rsquo;s the only man in the whole crew I don&rsquo;t know
well. I see it all now. He sent me a note the night
before asking to ship on the <i>Lass</i>, and I went to get
him before any of the other skippers got wind of it.
You don&rsquo;t suppose he did this thing on his own account,
do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy, skipper, easy! What&rsquo;s he got against
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>He&rsquo;s</i> got nothing against me!&rdquo; cried Code passionately.
&ldquo;But he is working for the man who
has. Do you think that stupid ox would have sense
enough to work a scheme like this? Never! Nat
Burns is behind this, and I&rsquo;ll bet my schooner on it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Schofield dumped the bait-tub over the deck and
rolled it around, examining it. Suddenly he stopped
and peered closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s proof!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a splitting knife that he snatched out of a
cleat he pried loose a tiny plug in one of the bottom
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
boards that had been replaced so carefully that it almost
defied detection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole thing is simple enough. He turned
the tub upside down, cut out this plug, and inserted
the acid. Then he refitted the plug and set it right
side up again. It&rsquo;s as plain as the nose on your
face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By thunder, I believe you&rsquo;re right, skipper!&rdquo;
said Ellinwood solemnly. &ldquo;The dirty dog!
Cookee, run that tub up to the truck again. We&rsquo;ll
have to call the men in on this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he was foxy, that one!&rdquo; said Code bitterly.
&ldquo;Going out in the fog that way so all hands would
think he was lost! I never remembered until this
minute that the motor-dory could be run. I guess
she went, all right, and that scoundrel is ashore by
this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had a bad name in Castalia, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a little more or less that I heard of, but
what&rsquo;s that in a fisherman? When the men come
in have them go through all the bait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pete fired the old rifle, and the crew at work began
to pull in through the choppy sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; cried the mate, looking behind him.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something going to be doin&rsquo; here in a
minute. It&rsquo;s the cutter from Halifax, all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Code, his former danger forgotten for the time,
glanced up. The smudge of smoke had quickly resolved
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
itself into a stubby, gray steam-vessel with a
few bright brass guns forward and a black cloud
belching from her funnel. She was still some five
miles away, but apparently coming at top speed.</p>
<p>Three miles before her, with all sails set, including
staysail and balloon-job, raced a fishing schooner.
There was a fresh ten-knot wind blowing a little
south of west&ndash;&ndash;a wind that favored the schooner,
and she was putting her best foot forward, taking
the green water over her bows in a smother of
foam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens! look at her go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The exclamation was one of pure delight in the
speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe she&rsquo;s an American that&rsquo;s been caught inside
the three-mile limit, and is pullin&rsquo; away from
the gunboat,&rdquo; remarked Pete.</p>
<p>That she was pulling away there was little doubt.
In the fifteen minutes that elapsed after her discovery
she had widened the gap between herself and her
pursuer. She was now within a mile of the <i>Lass</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t she shoot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Code spoke a puff of white smoke thrust out
from the blunt bows of the cutter, and the ball ricochetted
from wave-top to wave-top to fall half a
mile astern of the schooner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of range now, an&rsquo; if the wind holds she&rsquo;ll
be out of sight by nightfall,&rdquo; said Pete, who was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
moved to great excitement and enthusiasm by the
contest. &ldquo;Wonder who she is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He plunged down the companionway to the cabin
and emerged a moment later with Code&rsquo;s powerful
glasses.</p>
<p>But Code did not need any glasses to tell him who
she was. His eye had picked out her points before
this, and the only thing that interested him was the
fact that her wireless was down.</p>
<p>It was the mysterious schooner.</p>
<p>He had never seen her equal for traveling, and he
knew that she must be making a good fourteen
knots, for the cutter was capable of twelve.</p>
<p>She had reached her closest point of contact with
Code&rsquo;s vessel and had begun to bear away when
Pete leveled his glasses. It was on Schofield&rsquo;s
tongue to reveal the identity of the pursued when
Ellinwood yelled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Heavens! Skipper! She has <i>Charming
Lass</i> printed in new gold letters under her
counter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I live, Code. <i>Charming Lass</i>, as plain as
day! What&rsquo;s happening here to-day? What is
this?&rdquo; Code snatched the glasses from Pete&rsquo;s hand
and then leveled them, trembling, at the flying
schooner.</p>
<p>For a time the foam and whirl of her wake obscured
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
matters, but all at once, as she plunged down
into a great hollow between waves, her stern came
clear and pointed to heaven. There, in bright letters
that glinted in the sun and were easily visible
at a much greater distance, was printed the name:</p>
<p class='center'>CHARMING LASS<br />
OF<br />
FREEKIRK HEAD</p>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder she&rsquo;s goin&rsquo;!&rdquo; yelled Pete, almost
beside himself with excitement. &ldquo;No wonder she&rsquo;s
goin&rsquo;! But let her go! More power to her!
Yah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Code stood with the glasses to his eyes and
watched the mysterious schooner and the pursuing
vessel disappear.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XIX_ELLINWOOD_TAKES_A_HAND' id='CHAPTER_XIX_ELLINWOOD_TAKES_A_HAND'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>ELLINWOOD TAKES A HAND</h3>
</div>
<p>There were two things for Code to do.
One was to sail north into Placentia Bay,
Newfoundland, set seines, and catch the
herring that were then schooling. The other was
to run sixty miles or so northeast to St. Pierre,
Miquelon, and buy bait.</p>
<p>Under ordinary circumstances he would not have
hesitated. It would have been Placentia Bay without
question. But his situation was now decidedly
out of the ordinary. He was in a hurry to fill his
hold with cod before the other men out of Freekirk
Head; first, for the larger prices he would get; and
secondly, because he yearned to come to grapples
with Nat Burns.</p>
<p>To seine for herring would lose him upward of a
week; to buy it would take less than three days, including
the round trip to St. Pierre.</p>
<p>But the money?</p>
<p>Code knew that in the French island herring seldom
went below three dollars a barrel, and that the
smallest amount he ought to buy would be twenty-five
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
barrels. Later on, if the fishing was good, he
might send out a party to set the seines, but not now.
He must buy. But the money!</p>
<p>Then he thought of the packet of money Elsa
Mallaby had sent him. The cash was meant for
any sailor who came to need it.</p>
<p>And the men with him were willing to fight to the
last ditch and to take their lot ungrumblingly as
fishermen early learn to do.</p>
<p>If he starved, they starved. So he decided he
would not hesitate to use Elsa&rsquo;s money when a dozen
men and their families were dependent upon him
and the success of the cruise.</p>
<p>Thus the matter was settled and the order roared
down the decks:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Set every stitch for St. Pierre; we&rsquo;re going to
bait up there. Lively, now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>St. Pierre, Miquelon, is one of the quaintest towns
in all of picturesque French Canada. It is on the
island of the same name (there are three Miquelon
islands), which is in itself a bold chunk of granite
sticking up out of the ocean at a distance of some
ten miles southwest of May Point, Newfoundland.</p>
<p>Rough and craggy, with few trees, sparse vegetation,
and a very thin coating of soil, there is no
agriculture, and the whole glory of the island is
centered in the roaring city on its southeast side.</p>
<p>It is a strange city, lost in the midst of busy up-to-date
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
Canada, with French roofs, narrow tilting
streets, and ever the smell of fish. There is a good
harbor, and there are wharfs where blackfaced men
with blue stockings, caps, and gold earrings chatter
the patois and smoke their pipes. In the busy time
of year there are ten thousand men in the town and
it is a scene of constant revelry and wildness.</p>
<p>The <i>Charming Lass</i> touched the port at the height
of its season&ndash;&ndash;early September&ndash;&ndash;and, because of
the shallowness of the harbor close in, anchored in
the bay amid a crowd of old high-pooped schooners,
filled with noisy, happy Frenchmen. There were
other nationalities, too, in the cosmopolitan bay&ndash;&ndash;Americans
setting a new spar or Nova Scotians in
on a good time.</p>
<p>The <i>Charming Lass</i> cast her anchor shortly before
six o&rsquo;clock, having made the run in five and a
half hours with a good breeze behind. Code and
Ellinwood immediately went over the side in the
brown dory of the mate and pulled for the customhouse
wharf. The rest of the crew were forbidden
off the decks except to sleep under them, for it was
intended, as soon as the bait was lightered aboard,
to make sail to the Banks again.</p>
<p>The bait industry in St. Pierre is one more or less
open to examination. It is the delight of certain
French dealers to go inside the English three-mile
limit, load their vessels with barrels of herring, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
return to St. Pierre. Here they sell them at magnificent
profit to Frenchmen, Englishmen, and Americans.
And, as the British coat of arms is not
stamped on herring at birth, no one can prove that
they were not legally procured.</p>
<p>But let a Canadian revenue cutter catch a Frenchman
(or American either, for that matter), dipping
herring in any out-of-the-way inlet, and the owner
not only pays a heavy fine, but he often loses his
schooner and his men go to jail for trying to hoist
sail and escape at the last minute.</p>
<p>Code had not reached shore before he had been
accosted by fully half a dozen of these bait pirates.
But he passed them, and tying his dory at the wharf,
went on up the street to a legitimate firm.</p>
<p>Immediately the business was finished, Code and
Pete Ellinwood started back to the wharf.</p>
<p>The main street was ablaze with lights. Caf&eacute;s,
saloons, music halls, catch-penny places&ndash;&ndash;in fact,
every device known to separate sailors from their
wages was in operation. The sidewalks were
crowded with men, jabbering madly in the different
dialects of their home provinces (for many come
here from France yearly).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer lot, these frog-eaters,&rdquo; said Pete, going
into the street so as to avoid a thick, pushing crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they would come to a knifing over a count
of fish and yet give their schooners to a friend in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
trouble. Too bad they ain&rsquo;t better fishermen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, ain&rsquo;t it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among Canadians and Americans the Frenchmen
are held in contempt on account of their hooks,
which are of soft metal and can be rebent and used
again. The fish often get away with them, however,
and these hidden hooks slit many a finger in
dressing down.</p>
<p>The two comrades loitered along, watching the
changing crowds, gay with their colored caps and
scarfs. Some men were already in liquor, and all
seemed to be headed in that general direction. Suddenly,
as Code was about to urge Pete along, he
gave an exclamation and stopped short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, skipper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder where he is now?&rdquo; Code&rsquo;s eyes
were searching the crowd. &ldquo;I saw him right over
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed to a certain spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who? What? Are you crazy, Code?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Arry Duncan, the traitor that ruined our bait.
I&rsquo;d have sworn I saw him. It came all of a sudden
and went away again. But I guess it couldn&rsquo;t
have been anything but a close resemblance.&rdquo; He
laughed nervously. &ldquo;Gave me the creeps for a
minute, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lor-rd!&rdquo; shivered Pete, who had all the superstitions
of the sea at his fingers&rsquo; ends. &ldquo;Mebbe
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
he&rsquo;s chasin&rsquo; us around fer wrongly accusin&rsquo; him.
They do that sometimes, you know. He&rsquo;s probably
dead an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s his sperrit, ha&rsquo;ntin&rsquo; us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, rot, Pete!&rdquo; growled Code in his most forcible
manner. &ldquo;Come along now or you&rsquo;ll be sidling
into one of these doors and the <i>Lass</i> won&rsquo;t get
out of port for a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My soul an&rsquo; body! Look at that Frenchy.
Biggest I ever saw, Code.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had returned to the sidewalk, and Pete forgot
that he himself rose fully as high above the
crowds as this stranger. In fact, nearly every one
turned to take a look at the huge islander, who, in
reality, stood six feet four, barefoot.</p>
<p>They were pushing down-street against the tide
and making rather heavy going of it. Code maneuvered
so as to pass well to leeward of the big
man who, he could see plainly, was just tipsy. But
somehow the eyes of the two giants met, and the
Frenchman seemed to crush his way through the
crowd in Ellinwood&rsquo;s direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Pete; get out of here before there&rsquo;s
any trouble,&rdquo; commanded Code. He knew the
mate&rsquo;s weakness for fighting.</p>
<p>The big Frenchman, who wore tremendous earrings,
a bright scarlet cap with a blue tuft, and a gay
sash, lurched through the crowd and against Pete
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
Ellinwood with a malice only too plain. But his effort
was attended with failure. Not only did Pete
stand like a rock, but he thrust the other violently
back with his shoulder, so that he recoiled upon
those behind him, earning their loud-voiced curses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mille tonnerres!</i>&rdquo; bellowed the Frenchman.
&ldquo;You insult me, <i>cochon Canadien</i>, Canadian pig!
The half of sidewalk is mine, eh? You push me off,
eh? You fight, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Code urged Ellinwood along and interceded personally,
knowing that the big man would not touch
him.</p>
<p>But the Frenchman would not be appeased. He
was just drunk enough to become obsessed with the
ugly idea that Pete had laid a trap to insult him, and,
regardless of Code, kept after the mate.</p>
<p>By this time, of course, a huge crowd had gathered
and was following Pete&rsquo;s retreat, yelling to
both men to fight it out. Many of the mob knew a
few English words, and their taunts reached Ellinwood&rsquo;s
ears.</p>
<p>He and Code had not retreated a block before the
mate suddenly swung around on his tormentors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t stand for that, Code. Did you hear
what that big devil called me?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you care what he called you? Get
along to the ship. What chance have we got with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
these men?&rdquo; Code grabbed Pete&rsquo;s arm and kept
him moving away. Beneath his hand he could feel
the muscles as hard as iron.</p>
<p>But every foot the Canadians retreated brought
the big Frenchman nearer, bawling with triumph.
At an opportune moment, so close was the press, he
slipped his foot between Ellinwood&rsquo;s legs and gave
him a push. Pete stumbled, almost fell, and recovered
himself, raging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get back you!&rdquo; he bawled, sending half a
dozen men spinning with sweeps of his great arms.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fight this Frenchy. Just let me at him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Code saw the rage in Pete&rsquo;s eyes and recognized
that he could do nothing more to avert the trouble.
His part would have to be confined to seeing that
his man got a fair deal. He and Pete were unarmed
except for their huge clasp-knives&ndash;&ndash;much better
kept out of sight under the circumstances.</p>
<p>The crowd fell back, and the two giants stripped
off their coats and shirts. The Frenchman danced
up and down, beating his great fists together in a fine
frenzy, but Pete, half-crouched, stepped forward on
his toes, his hands hanging loose and ready at his
sides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Allez, donc!</i>&rdquo; It was the starting word, and
Jean leaped in. Pete met him with a crashing right
to the ribs and dodged out of reach of the clutching
hands that reached for his throat. They circled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
around a moment and again the Frenchman came,
this time in one great leap.</p>
<p>On the instant Ellinwood jumped in to meet him.
There was a swift flying of arms, a pounding of the
great fists, and Pete suddenly shot back from the
m&ecirc;l&eacute;e and landed on his back in the dirt. One of
the Frenchman&rsquo;s great swings had landed. But he
was up in an instant and went after his opponent
again.</p>
<p>Jean saw now that he had another man to deal
with&ndash;&ndash;unlike a Frenchman, an Anglo-Saxon cannot
fight without sufficient provocation. Now all the
battle was aroused in Ellinwood, for aside from the
shame of his downfall, the crowd was yelling at the
top of its voice. Jean began to run away, circling
round and round the ring of spectators, Pete after
him.</p>
<p>Suddenly he made a stand, but the mate was ready
for him. Dodging the straight left, Pete hurled
himself forward and seized the burly Frenchman in
his arms. Then, with a tug and a wrench, as
though he were uprooting a tree, he lifted his opponent
and crashed him down to the earth.</p>
<p>Jean, stunned, and with a broken arm, sought to
get up. He gained his feet and, game to the last,
staggered toward Ellinwood. Pete started to run in
again, but some one on the edge of the crowd thrust
a foot out and the big islander stumbled.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></div>
<p>Code saw the man who interfered, and, his blood
boiling, leaped for him. At the same instant there
came a cry of &ldquo;Police! Police!&rdquo; But Code did
not hesitate. He plunged into the crowd after his
man and, in an instant, found himself surrounded
and fighting the whole mob.</p>
<p>For a moment it lasted. There was a rain of
heavy blows that blinded him, and then something
that was hard and dull struck him on the head.
Everything began to whirl, and he found he could
not lift his arms. Dimly he heard a voice near him
shout: &ldquo;This way!&rdquo; in English and felt himself
gathered up by men and borne swiftly away.</p>
<p>Then consciousness left him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>AMONG THE HOME FOLKS</h3>
</div>
<p>The village of Freekirk Head was a
changed place.</p>
<p>No longer of early mornings did the
resounding <i>pop! pop!</i> of motor-dories ring back
from the rocks and headland as the trawlers and
hand-liners put to sea. No longer did the groups
of weary fishermen gather on the store steps for an
evening pipe and chat or the young bloods chuck
horseshoes at the foot of the chapel hill.</p>
<p>It was a village of women. True, Squire Hardy,
being too old to fish, had remained at home, and
Bill Boughton, who was completing details for the
immediate and profitable sale of the season&rsquo;s catch,
was behind the counter of his general store.</p>
<p>He dealt out supplies to the women and children,
and wrote down against their fathers&rsquo; shares the
amount of credit extended. But others, day after
day, found nothing set against them, and this was
due to the promise of help that Elsa Mallaby kept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s useless to charge supplies to those who have
nothing now with the idea of getting it back from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
their fishing profits,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What they earn
will just about pay for it, and then there they are
back where they started&ndash;&ndash;with nothing. Better
let me pay for everything until the men get back.
Then they will have something definite ahead to go
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one but Adelbert Bysshe, the rector, Bill
Boughton, and Elsa Mallaby herself knew exactly
how much she paid out weekly toward the maintenance
of the village. But all knew it to be an enormous
sum (as reckoned on the island), and daily
the worship of Hard Luck Jim&rsquo;s widow grew, until
she occupied a place in Freekirk Head parallel to a
patron saint of the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>But Elsa Mallaby was intensely human, and no
one knew it better than herself, as, one late afternoon,
she sat at her mahogany table, looking absently
over the stubs in her check-book. She saw that she
had disbursed a great deal of money&ndash;&ndash;more, perhaps,
than she would have under any other circumstances&ndash;&ndash;but
she frankly acknowledged that she
did not mind that, if only she achieved the end toward
which she was working.</p>
<p>For Elsa, more than any one on Grande Mignon,
was a person of ways and means.</p>
<p>She was one of those women who seem to find
nothing in self-communion. Hers was a nature destined
for light and gaiety and happiness. To sit in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
a splendid palace and mope over what had happened
was among the last things she cared to contemplate.</p>
<p>Being of the pure Grande Mignon stock, she
looked no farther for a husband than among the
men of Freekirk Head, good, honest, able men, all
of them. And her eye fell with favor upon Captain
Code Schofield of the schooner <i>Charming Lass</i>,
old schoolfellow, playmate, and lifelong friend.</p>
<p>The money she had mailed to him had only been
an excuse to write a letter; the favors to Ma Schofield
were, in great part, to help further her plan;
the whole business of helping support Freekirk
Head was a flash of dramatic display, calculated to
bring her ineradicably before Code&rsquo;s eyes&ndash;&ndash;and
every one else&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>As she sat near the window and saw the sunset
glow die over the mountain ridge she asked herself
what she had achieved. Apparently very little.
She felt the futility of human endeavor and desire.
To her knowledge Code was in love with nobody, although
rumor had for years linked his name with
Nellie Tanner&rsquo;s. That was exploded now, for
Nellie was engaged to Nat Burns.</p>
<p><i>Why</i> did he not respond?</p>
<p>Slowly her smile returned. He would respond
when he had heard certain other things. Then he
would forget any one else but her&ndash;&ndash;if there was
any one else. Her heart leaped at the thought.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></div>
<p>As it became dark she rang the bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Light the candles in the drawing-room,&rdquo; she
said to the servant who entered. &ldquo;You remember
that Mrs. Tanner is coming for dinner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, madam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well. That is all.&rdquo; The servant withdrew.</p>
<p>There was nothing unusual in the fact of Mrs.
Tanner coming for dinner in the evening to the big
house. Elsa simply could not eat all her meals
alone, and her old friends at the village were constantly
receiving invitations.</p>
<p>Mrs. Tanner arrived at half-past six. It was her
first visit since the departure of the fleet several
weeks before, and there was plenty to talk about.
But Ma Tanner wisely reserved her conversation
until after the meal, for the &ldquo;vittles&rdquo; of Mallaby
House were famous the whole length of the New
Brunswick coast.</p>
<p>Afterward when they had retired to Elsa&rsquo;s pink
and gray boudoir, the eternal envy of Grande Mignon
womanhood, the talk flowed freely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this way, Elsa,&rdquo; declared ma confidentially.
&ldquo;I think Nellie is pretty well took care of. Now
young Nat Burns, as you know, is pretty well off, as
the sayin&rsquo; goes on the island. He really wouldn&rsquo;t
have to fish if he didn&rsquo;t want to. His father didn&rsquo;t
neglect <i>him</i> when his time come.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></div>
<p>Ma Tanner did not see the change in Elsa&rsquo;s expression.
The pupils of her magnificent black eyes
expanded and the delicate brows drew together over
the bridge of her nose. The close mouth, with its
ugly set, would not have been recognized by any but
lifelong friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Nat&rsquo;s about&rsquo;s good as any boy,&rdquo; went on
ma. &ldquo;Boys is turr&rsquo;ble hard to fetch up so they
don&rsquo;t disgrace ye and send ye to the grave with gray
head bowed in sorter, as the poet says. Nat ain&rsquo;t
bad. He speaks sharp to his mother once in a
while, but la&ndash;&ndash;what boy don&rsquo;t? I think he&rsquo;ll treat
Nellie right and be a good man to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ma,&rdquo; said Elsa, and her voice was quiet and
intense as though she were keeping herself well in
hand, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what <i>every one</i> thinks about Nat
Burns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; asked the elder woman, slightly resentful,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I think has nothing whatever to do with
the question. But what I <i>know</i> might have. I
don&rsquo;t want Nellie&rsquo;s life ruined, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Elsa, what&rsquo;re you drivin&rsquo; at?&rdquo;
Ma Turner was becoming wrought up. She knew
there must be something behind these hints or Elsa
would never venture on such thin ice with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye be&rsquo;n&rsquo;t by any means jealous o&rsquo; Nellie, be
ye?&rdquo; she asked, peering through her spectacles.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens, no!&rdquo; cried Elsa so convincingly that
Mrs. Tanner was satisfied once and for all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, what&rsquo;s all the fuss, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any girl would ruin her life that threw herself
away on Nat Burns. He&rsquo;s got a fine solid-gold case,
but his works are very poor indeed, Ma Tanner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go talkin&rsquo; educated or I can&rsquo;t follow ye.
D&rsquo;ye mean he&rsquo;s all show an&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; in his mind or
heart of Christian goodness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I mean that, and I mean more besides.
He doesn&rsquo;t stop by being merely &lsquo;not good.&rsquo; He
is actively and busily downright bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;s several kinds of &lsquo;bad,&rsquo; Elsa Mallaby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I mean the kind that makes a girl break
her engagement and keep it broken, and that drives
a man out of a decent village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a long and pregnant pause while Ma
Tanner got everything straight in her mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that he has&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; she inquired,
her little mouth a thin, hard line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do. Exactly that. I knew the case myself
in this very village before Jim died. There
are some men who instinctively take the correct
course in a matter of that kind; others who don&rsquo;t
care two pins as long as they get out of it with a
whole skin. Nat Burns was that kind.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Then you mean he ought already to be married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, or in jail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was entirely up to the girl and she refused
to act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gawd! My poor Nellie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The servant knocked, and, upon receiving permission
to enter, handed Elsa a telegram, evidently
just delivered from the village telegraph office. Unconsciously
the girl reached into a glass-covered
bookcase and drew forth a paper volume. Then
she tore open the message and commenced to read it
with the aid of the book.</p>
<p>Mrs. Tanner did not notice her. She sat staring
into the future with a leaden heart. Such a thing as
Elsa hinted at was unheard of in Freekirk Head,
and she was overwhelmed. Suddenly she asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you hate Nat Burns so? You couldn&rsquo;t
have told me that if you hadn&rsquo;t hated him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsa looked up from her book impatiently, quite
oblivious to the wound she had caused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I was very fond of that girl!&rdquo; she said,
and went back to the translation of the message.
Suddenly she sprang to her feet with a little cry of
dismay and rang the bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Annette!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Annette!&rdquo; The maid
rushed in, frightened, from the adjoining room.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell Charles I am going to St. John&rsquo;s to-morrow,
and to have the carriage at the door at half-past six.
Pack my steamer trunk immediately. Great guns!
Why isn&rsquo;t there a night boat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The maid flew out of the room, and Elsa, still
doubtful, retranslated the message. Mrs. Tanner,
taken aback by these sudden activities, rose hurriedly
to go. This sudden flurry was inexplicable to her.
Since the departure of the fleet Elsa had not as much
as hinted leaving Freekirk Head. Now, in a moment,
she was beside herself to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it isn&rsquo;t bad news, Elsa,&rdquo; she faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it is, ma, it is, b-but only in a business
way. A little trip will straighten it up, I think.&rdquo;
And she was courteous but indefatigable in hastening
the departure of her guest.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>A PRISONER</h3>
</div>
<p>When Code Schofield came to himself his
first sensation was one of oppression, such
as is felt after sleeping in an unventilated
room. It seemed difficult for him to breathe, but
his body was quite free and uninjured, as he found
by moving himself carefully in all directions before
he even opened his eyes.</p>
<p>Presently the air became familiar. It was a perfect
mixture of flavors; oilskins, stale tobacco-smoke,
brine, burned grease, tar, and, as a background,
fish. His ears almost immediately detected water noises
running close by, and he could feel the pull of
stout oak timber that formed the inner wall of where
he lay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;stle of a fishing schooner!&rdquo; he announced,
and then opened his eyes to prove that he was correct.</p>
<p>He looked out into a three-cornered room occupied
by a three-cornered table, and that ran as far
back as the foremast. Above, fastened to a huge
square beam, hung a chain-lamp so swiveled that it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
kept itself level however much the schooner kicked
and wriggled. On the table, swinging his legs, sat
a large, unpleasant-looking man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, how are ye?&rdquo; asked this latter, seeing his
charge had recovered consciousness. Never having
seen the man before, Code did not consider it necessary
to answer. So he wriggled to find out if any
bones were broken, and, in the end, discovered a
tender knob on the right side of his head.</p>
<p>He soon recalled the visit to St. Pierre, the purchase
of the bait, Pete Ellinwood&rsquo;s fight, the general
mix-up, and the blow on the head that had finished
him. He sat up suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here! What ship is this?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find out soon enough when you go on
deck. Hungry? I got orders to feed ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet I&rsquo;m hungry; didn&rsquo;t have any dinner last
night in St. Pierre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two nights ago,&rdquo; said the other, beginning to
fry salt pork. &ldquo;Nigh thirty-six hours you&rsquo;ve laid
here like a log.&rdquo; Code doubted it, but did not
argue. He was trying to puzzle out the situation.</p>
<p>If this was a fishing schooner the men ought to
be over the side fishing, and she would be at anchor.
Instead, feeling the long, steady heel to leeward and
half-recover to windward, he knew she was flying on
a course.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></div>
<p>Breakfast swallowed, he made his way on deck.
As he came up the companionway a man stood leaning
against the rail. With a feeling of violent revulsion,
Code recognized Nat Burns. A glance at
a near-by dory showed the lettering <i>Nettie B.</i>, and
Schofield at once recognized his position.</p>
<p>He was Nat Burns&rsquo;s prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mornin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Burns curtly. &ldquo;Thought you
were goin&rsquo; to sleep forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hanging offense putting any one to sleep
that long,&rdquo; retorted Code cheerfully. &ldquo;Luck was
with you, and I woke up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re hardly in a position to joke about hanging
offenses,&rdquo; remarked Nat venomously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Code had gone a sickly pallor
that looked hideous through his tan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; home to St. Andrew&rsquo;s to be
tried for one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Code glanced over his left shoulder. The sun
was there. The schooner was headed almost directly
southwest. Nat had spoken the truth. They
were headed homeward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your warrant?&rdquo; Code could feel his
teeth getting on edge with rage as he talked to this
captor who bore himself with such insolence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t need a warrant for murder cases, and I&rsquo;m
a constable at Freekirk Head, so everything is being
done according to law. The gunboat didn&rsquo;t find
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
you, so I thought, as long as you were right to hand,
I&rsquo;d bring you along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you knew I was in St. Pierre?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; saw you come in. If it hadn&rsquo;t been so
dark you&rsquo;d have recognized the <i>Nettie</i> not far
away.&rdquo; Code, remembering the time of night they
arrived, knew this to be impossible, for it is dark
at six in September. He had barely been able to
make out the lines of the nearest schooners.</p>
<p>A man was standing like a statue at the wheel,
and, as he put the vessel over on the port tack, his
face came brightly into the sun. It was &rsquo;Arry Duncan.
Code had not been wrong, then, in thinking
that he had seen the man&rsquo;s face in St. Pierre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine traitor you&rsquo;ve got there at the wheel,&rdquo;
said Schofield. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll do you brown some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. Just because he did you,
doesn&rsquo;t prove anything. He was in my employ all
the time, and getting real money for his work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it was all a plot, eh?&rdquo; said Code dejectedly.
&ldquo;I give you credit, Burns, for more brains than I
ever supposed you had. What&rsquo;s become of Pete
Ellinwood and the <i>Lass?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pete is back on the schooner and she&rsquo;s gone out
to fish. You needn&rsquo;t worry about them. At the
proper time they&rsquo;ll be told you are safe and unhurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Code said nothing for a while. With hands
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
rammed into his pockets he stood watching the white
and blue sea whirl by. In those few minutes he
touched the last depth of failure and despair. For
a brief space he was minded to leap overboard.</p>
<p>He shivered as one with an ague and shook off the
deadly influence of the idea. Had he no more grit?
he asked himself. Had he come this far only to be
beaten? Was this insolent young popinjay to win
at last? <i>No!</i> Then he listened, for Nat was
speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you give your word of honor not to try and
escape you can have the run of the decks and go
anywhere you like on the schooner. If not, you
will be locked up and go home a prisoner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the last straw, the final piece of humiliation.
Code stiffened as a soldier might to rebuke.
A deadly, dull anger surged within him and took
possession of his whole being&ndash;&ndash;such an anger as
can only come to one who, amiable and upright by
nature, is driven to inevitable revolt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Burns,&rdquo; he said, his voice low, but
intense with the emotion that mastered him, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
give no word of honor regarding anything. Between
you and me there is a lot to be settled. You
have almost ruined me, and, by Heaven, before I
get through with you, you&rsquo;ll rue it!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall make every attempt to escape from this
schooner, and if I do escape, look out! If I do not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
escape and you press these charges against me, I&rsquo;ll
hunt you down for the rest of my life; or if I go to
prison I will have others do it for me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you know what to expect, and you also
know that when I say a thing I mean it. Now do
what you like with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Burns looked at Schofield&rsquo;s tense white face.
His eyes encountered those flaming blue ones and
dropped sullenly. Whether it was the tremendous
force of the threat or whether it was a guilty conscience
working, no one but himself knew, but his
face grew gradually as pallid as that of his captive.
Suddenly he turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; he called to the crew who were working
near, &ldquo;put Schofield in the old storeroom. And
one of you watch it all the time. He says he will
escape if he can, so I hold you responsible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Code followed the men to a little shanty seemingly
erected against the foremast. It was of stout,
heavy boards about long enough to allow a cot being
set up in it. It had formerly been used for storing
provisions and had never been taken down.</p>
<p>When the padlock snapped behind him Code took
in his surroundings. There were two windows in
the little cubby, one looking forward and the other
to starboard. Neither was large enough to provide
a means of escape, he judged. At the foot of the
cot was a plain wooden armchair, both pieces of furniture
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
being screwed to the floor. For exercise
there was a strip of bare deck planking about six
feet long beside the bed, where he might pace back
and forth.</p>
<p>Both the cot and chair appeared to be new.
&ldquo;Had the room all ready for me,&rdquo; said Code to
himself.</p>
<p>The one remaining piece of furniture was a queer
kind of book-shelf nailed against the wall. It was
fully five feet long and protruded a foot out above
his bed. In its thirty-odd pigeonholes was jammed
a collection of stuff that was evidently the accumulation
of years. There were scores of cheap paper-bound
novels concerning either high society or great
detectives, old tobacco-boxes, broken pipes, string,
wrapping-paper, and all the what-not of a general
depository.</p>
<p>With hours on his hands and nothing whatever to
occupy him, Code began to sort over the lurid literature
with a view to his entertainment. He
hauled a great dusty bundle out of one pigeonhole,
and found among the novels some dusty exercise
books.</p>
<p>He inspected them curiously. On the stiff board
cover of one was scrawled, &ldquo;Log Schooner <i>M. C.
Burns</i>; M. C. Burns, master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The novels were forgotten with the appearance
of this old relic. <i>The M. C. Burns</i> was the original
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
Burns schooner when Nat&rsquo;s father was still in the
fish business at Freekirk Head. It was the direct
predecessor of the <i>Nettie B.</i>, which was entirely
Nat&rsquo;s. On the death of the elder Burns when the
<i>May Schofield</i> went down, the <i>M. C. Burns</i> had
been sold to realize immediate cash. And here was
her log!</p>
<p>Code looked over pages that were redolent of the
events in his boyhood, for Michael was a ready
writer and made notes regularly even when the
<i>M. C.</i> was not on a voyage. He had spent an hour
in this way when he came to this entry on one of the
very last pages:</p>
<p>&ldquo;June 30: This day clear with strong E. S.-E.
wind. This day Nat, in the <i>M. C. Burns</i>, raced
Code Schofield in the <i>May Schofield</i> from Quoddy
Head to moorings in Freekirk Head harbor. My
boy had the worst of it all the way. I never saw
such luck as that young Schofield devil has. He
won by half an hour. Poor Nat is heartbroken
and swore something awful. He says he&rsquo;ll win next
time or know why!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just like old man Burns!&rdquo; thought Code.
&ldquo;Pities and spoils his rascal of a son. But the boy
loved him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Code had not thought of that race in years.
How well he remembered it now! There had been
money up on both sides, and the rules were that no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
one in either schooner should be over twenty except
the skippers.</p>
<p>What satisfaction it had been to give Nat a good
trimming in the fifty-year-old <i>May</i>. He could still
feel an echo of the old proud thrill. He turned
back to the log.</p>
<p>&ldquo;July 1: Cloudy this day. Hot. Light S.-W.
breeze. Nat tells me another race will be sailed in
just a week. Swears he will win it. Poor boy,
what with losing yesterday and Caroline Fuller&rsquo;s
leaving the Head to work in Lubec, he is hardly himself.
I&rsquo;m afraid the old <i>M. C.</i> won&rsquo;t show much
speed till she is thoroughly overhauled. Note&ndash;&ndash;Stmr.
<i>May Schofield&rsquo;s</i> policy runs out July 20th.
See about this, sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was very little pertaining to the next race
until the entry for June 6, two days before the event.
Then he read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nat is quite happy; says he can&rsquo;t lose day after
to-morrow. I told him he must have fitted the
<i>M. C.</i> with wings, but he only grinned. Take the
stmr. to St. John to-morrow to look after policies,
including <i>May Schofield&rsquo;s</i>. She&rsquo;s so old her rates
will have to go up. Won&rsquo;t be back till day after the
race, but Nat says he&rsquo;ll telegraph me. Wonder
what business that boy&rsquo;s got up his sleeve that makes
him so sure he will win? Oh, he&rsquo;s a clever one, that
boy!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></div>
<p>Here the chronicle ended. Little did Michael
Burns know he would never write in it again. He
went to St. John&rsquo;s, as he had said, and completed his
business in time to return home the day of the race
instead of the day after.</p>
<p>The second race was never sailed, for Code Schofield
received a telegram from St. John&rsquo;s, offering him
a big price for a quick lighterage trip to Grande Mignon,
St. John being accidentally out of schooners
and the trip urgent.</p>
<p>Though loath to lose the race by default, the
money offered was too good to pass by, and Code
had made the trip and loaded up by nightfall. It
was then that he had met Michael Burns, and Burns
had expressed his desire to go home in the <i>May</i> so
as to watch her actions in a moderate sea and gale.</p>
<p>Neither he nor the <i>May</i> ever saw dry land again.
Only Code of the whole ship&rsquo;s company struggled
ashore on the Wolves, bruised and half dead from
exposure.</p>
<p>The end of the old log before him was full of
poignant tragedy to Code, the tragedy of his own
life, for it was the unwritten pages from then on
that should have told the story of a fiendishly
planned revenge upon him who was totally innocent
of any wrong-doing. The easy, weak, indulgence of
the father had grown a crop of vicious and cruel
deeds in the son.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>A RECOVERED TREASURE</h3>
</div>
<p>For five days Code yawned or rushed through
the greater part of Nat&rsquo;s stock of lurid literature.
It was the one thing that kept him
from falling into the black pit of brooding; sometimes
he felt as though he must go insane if he allowed
himself to think. He had not the courage
to tear aside the veil of dull pain that covered his
heart and look at the bleeding reality. He was
afraid of his own emotions.</p>
<p>It was impossible for him to go lower in the scale
of physical events.</p>
<p>Nat was about to triumph, and Code himself was
forced to admit that this triumph was mostly due to
Nat&rsquo;s own wits. First he had stolen Nellie Tanner
(Code had thought a lot about that ring missing
from Nellie&rsquo;s hand), then he had attached the
<i>Charming Lass</i> in the endeavor to take away from
him the very means of his livelihood.</p>
<p>Then something had happened. Schofield did
not know what it was, but something evidently very
serious, for the next thing he knew Nat had crushed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
his pride and manhood under a brutal and technical
charge of murder.</p>
<p>But this was not all.</p>
<p>His victim escaping him with the schooner and the
means of livelihood, Burns had employed a traitor
in the crew to poison the bait and force him to come
ashore to replenish his tubs. Once ashore, the
shanghaiing was not difficult.</p>
<p>Code had no doubt whatever that the whole plan,
commencing with the disappearance of the man in
the motor-dory and ending with his abduction from
St. Pierre, was part and parcel of the same scheme.
In this, his crowning achievement of skill and cunning,
Burns had showed himself an admirable plotter,
playing upon human nature as he did to effect
his ends.</p>
<p>For it was nothing but a realization of Peter Ellinwood&rsquo;s
weakness in the matter of his size and
fighting ability that resulted in his (Code&rsquo;s) easy
capture. Schofield had no shadow of a doubt but
that the big Frenchman had been hired to play his
part, and that, in the howling throng that surrounded
the fighters the crew of the <i>Nettie B.</i> were
waiting to seize the first opportunity to make the
duel a <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> and effect their design in the confusion.</p>
<p>Their opportunity came when the Frenchman
tried to trip Pete Ellinwood after big Jean had
fallen and Code rushed into the fray with the ferocity
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
of a wildcat. Some one raised the yell &ldquo;Police,&rdquo;
he was surrounded by his enemies, some one
rapped him over the head with a black-jack, and the
job was done. It was clever business, and despite
the helplessness of his position, Code could not but
admire the brilliance of such a scheming brain, while
at the same time deploring that it was not employed
in some legitimate and profitable cause.</p>
<p>Now he was in the enemy&rsquo;s hands, and St. Andrew&rsquo;s
was less than a dozen hours away; St. Andrew&rsquo;s,
with its jail, its grand jury, and its pen.</p>
<p>Life aboard the <i>Nettie B.</i> had been a dead monotony.
On the foremast above Code&rsquo;s prison
hung the bell that rang the watches, so that the passage
of every half hour was dinged into his ears.
Three times a day he was given food, and twice a
day he was allowed to pace up and down the deck, a
man holding tightly to each arm.</p>
<p>The weather had been propitious, with a moderate
sea and a good quartering wind. The <i>Nettie</i>
had footed it properly, and Code&rsquo;s experienced eye
had, on one occasion, seen her log her twelve knots
in an hour. The fact had raised his estimation of
her fifty per cent.</p>
<p>It must not be supposed that, as Code sat in his
hard wooden chair, he forgot the diary that he had
read the first afternoon of his incarceration. Often
he thought of it, and often he drew it out from its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
place and reread those last entries: &ldquo;Swears he
will win second race,&rdquo; &ldquo;Says he can&rsquo;t lose day after
to-morrow,&rdquo; &ldquo;I wonder what the boy has got up his
sleeve that makes him so sure he will win?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first Code merely ascribed these recorded sayings
of Nat Burns to youthful disappointment and a
sportsmanlike determination to do better next time.
But not for long. He remembered as though it had
been yesterday the look with which Nat had favored
him when he finally came ashore beaten, and the
sullen resentment with which he greeted any remarks
concerning the race.</p>
<p>There was no sportsmanlike determination about
him! Code quickly changed his point of view.
How could Nat be so sure he was going to win?</p>
<p>The thing was ridiculous on the face of it. The
fifty-year-old <i>May</i> had limped in half an hour ahead
of the thirty-year-old <i>M. C. Burns</i> after a race of
fifteen miles. How, then, could Nat swear with
any degree of certainty that he would win the second
time. It was well known that the <i>M. C. Burns</i> was
especially good in heavy weather, but how could Nat
ordain that there would be just the wind and sea he
wanted?</p>
<p>The thing was absurd on the face of it, and, besides,
silly braggadocio, if not actually malicious.
And even if it were malicious, Code thanked Heaven
that the race had not been sailed, and that he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
been spared the exhibition of Nat&rsquo;s malice. He
had escaped that much, anyway.</p>
<p>However, from motives of general caution, Code
decided to take the book with him. Nat had evidently
forgotten it, and he felt sure he would get off
the ship with it in his possession. Now, as he drew
near to St. Andrews, he put it for the last time inside
the lining of his coat, and fastened that lining
together with pins, of which he always carried a
stock under his coat-lapel.</p>
<p>As Schofield had not forgotten the old log of the
<i>M. C. Burns</i>, neither had he forgotten the threat he
made to Nat that he would try his best to escape,
and would defy his authority at every turn.</p>
<p>He had tried to fulfil his promise to the letter.
Twice he had removed one of the windows before
the alert guard detected him, and once he had nearly
succeeded in cutting his way through the two-inch
planking of his ceiling before the chips and sawdust
were discovered, and he was deprived of his clasp-knife.</p>
<p>Every hour of every day his mind had been constantly
on this business of escape. Even during the
reading, to which he fled to protect his reason, it
was the motive of every chapter, and he would drop
off in the middle of a page into a reverie, and grow
inwardly excited over some wild plan that mapped
itself out completely in his feverish brain.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></div>
<p>Now as they approached St. Andrew&rsquo;s his determination
was as strong as ever, but his resources were
exhausted. Double-guarded and without weapons,
he found himself helpless. The fevered excitement
of the past four days had subsided into a dull apathy
of hurt in which his brain was as delicate and alert
as the mainspring of a watch. He was resigned to
the worst if it came, but was ready, like a panther
in a tree, to spring at the slightest false move of his
enemies.</p>
<p>Now for the last time he went over his little eight-by-ten
prison. He examined the chair as though it
were some instrument of the Inquisition. He pulled
the bed to pieces and handled every inch of the
frame. He emptied every compartment of the
queer hanging cabinet that had been stuffed with
books and miscellanies; he examined every article in
the room.</p>
<p>He had done this a dozen times before, but some
instinct drove him to repeat the process. There was
always hope of the undiscovered, and, besides, he
needed the physical action and the close application
of his mind. So, mechanically and doggedly he
went over every inch of his little prison.</p>
<p>But in vain.</p>
<p>The roof and walls were of heavy planking and
were old. They were full of nicks as well as
wood-knots, and the appearance of some of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
former gave Code an idea. He went carefully over
the boards, sticking his thumb-nail into them and lifting
or pressing down as the shape of the nick warranted.
For they resembled very much the depressions
cut in sliding covers on starch-boxes whereby
such covers can be pushed in their grooves.</p>
<p>At any other time he would have considered this
the occupation of a madman, but now it kept him
occupied and held forth the faint gleam of hope by
which he now lived.</p>
<p>Suddenly something happened. He was lying
across his immovable cot fingering the boards low
down in the right rear corner when he felt something
give beneath his thumb. A flash of hope almost
stifled him, and he lay quiet for a moment to regain
command of himself. Then he put his thumb again
in the niche and lifted up. With all his strength
he lifted and, all at once, a panel rushed up and
stuck, revealing a little box perhaps a foot square
that had been built back from the rear wall of the
old storeroom.</p>
<p>That was all, except for the fact that something
was in the box&ndash;&ndash;a package done up in paper.</p>
<p>For a while he did not investigate the package,
but devoted his attention to sounding the rest of the
near-by planks with the hope that they might give
into a larger opening and furnish a means of egress.
For half an hour he worked and then gave up. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
had covered every inch of wall and every niche, and
this was all!</p>
<p>At last he turned to the contents of the box that
he had uncovered. Removing the package, he slid
the cover down over the opening for fear that his
guard, looking in a window, might become aware
of what he had discovered. Then, sitting on the
bed, he unwrapped the package.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful, clear mirror bound with silver
nickel and fitted with screw attachments as though
it were intended to be fastened to something.</p>
<p>At first this unusual discovery meant nothing
whatever to him. Then, as he turned the object
listlessly in his hands, his eyes fell upon three engraved
letters, C. A. S., and a date, 1908.</p>
<p>Then he remembered.</p>
<p>When he was twenty years old his father had
taught him the science of navigation, so that if anything
happened Code might sail the old <i>May Schofield</i>.</p>
<p>Because of the fact that a position at sea was
found by observing the heavenly bodies, Code had
become interested in astronomy, and had learned to
chart them on a sky map of his own.</p>
<p>The object in his hand was an artificial horizon, a
mirror attached to the sextant which could be fixed
at the exact angle of the horizon should the real
horizon be obscured. This valuable instrument his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
father had given him on his twenty-first birthday because
the old man had been vastly pleased with his
interest in a science of which he himself knew little
or nothing.</p>
<p>Code remembered that, for a year or two, he had
pursued this hobby of his with deep interest and considerable
success, and that his great object in life
had been to some day have a small telescope of his
own by which to learn more of the secrets of the
heavens. But, after his father died, he had been
forced to take up the active support of the family,
and had let this passion die.</p>
<p>But how did it happen that the mirror was here?</p>
<p>He recalled that the rest of his paraphernalia had
gone to the bottom with the <i>May Schofield</i>. It was
true that he had not overhauled his equipment for
some time, and that it had been in a drawer in the
<i>May&rsquo;s</i> cabin, but that drawer had not been
opened.</p>
<p>He pursued the train of thought no farther. His
brain was tired and his head ached with the strain
of the last five days. His last hope of escape had
only resulted in his finding a forgotten mirror, and
his despair shut out any other consideration. He
had not even the fire to resent the fact that it was in
Burns&rsquo;s possession, and concealed.</p>
<p>It was his, he knew, and, without further thought
of it, he thrust it into his pocket just as he heard the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
men outside his little prison talking together excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By George, she looks like a gunboat,&rdquo; said one.
&ldquo;I wonder what she wants?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s her colors. You can see the sun
shinin&rsquo; on her brass guns forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, she&rsquo;s signalin&rsquo;. I wonder what she
wants?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Code walked idly to his windows and peered out,
but could not see the vessel that the men were talking
about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wants us to heave to, boys,&rdquo; sang out Nat
suddenly. &ldquo;Stand by to bring her up into the wind.
Hard down with your wheel, John!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the schooner&rsquo;s head veered Code caught a
glimpse of a schooner-rigged vessel half a mile away
with uniformed men on her decks and two gleaming
brass cannon forward. Then she passed out of
vision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s sending a cutter aboard,&rdquo; said one man.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>SURPRISES</h3>
</div>
<p>Fifteen minutes later a small boat, rowed
smartly by six sailors in white canvas, came
alongside the &rsquo;midships ladder of the <i>Nettie
B.</i> At a word from the officer the six oars rose
as one vertically into the air, and the bowman staved
off the cutter so that she brought up without a
scratch.</p>
<p>A young man in dark blue sprang out of the stern-sheets
upon the deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Nettie B.</i> of Freekirk Head?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;Captain Burns commanding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Nat, stepping forward, &ldquo;I am Captain
Burns. What do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I come from the gunboat <i>Albatross</i>,&rdquo; said the
officer, &ldquo;and represent Captain Foraker. You have
on board, have you not, a man named Code Schofield,
also of Freekirk Head, under arrest for the
murder of a man or men on the occasion of the sinking
of his schooner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nat scowled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I arrested him myself in St.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
Pierre, Miquelon. I am a constable in Freekirk
Head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as we understood,&rdquo; remarked the officer
blandly. &ldquo;Captain Foraker desires me to thank
you for your prompt and efficient work in this matter,
though I can tell you on the side, Captain Burns,
that the old man is rather put out that he didn&rsquo;t get
the fellow himself. We chased up and down the
Banks looking for him, but never got within sight
of as much as his main truck sticking over the horizon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the <i>Petrel</i>&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s our steamer, you
know&ndash;&ndash;well, sir, maybe he didn&rsquo;t make a fool of
her. Payson, on the <i>Petrel</i>, is the ugliest man in the
service, and when this fellow Schofield led him a
chase of a hundred and fifty miles, and then got
away among the islands of Placentia Bay, they say
Payson nearly had apoplexy. So your getting him
ought to be quite a feather in your cap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I consider that I did my duty. But would you
mind telling me what you have signaled me for?&rdquo;
Burns resented the gossip of this young whipper-snapper
of the service who seemed, despite his
frankness, to have something of a patronizing air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. Captain Foraker desires me to tell
you that he wished the prisoner transferred to the
<i>Albatross</i>. We know that you are not provided
with an absolutely secure place to keep the prisoner,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
and, as we are on our way to St. Andrews on another
matter, the skipper thinks he might just as
well take the fellow in and hand him over to the
authorities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t agree with your skipper,&rdquo; snapped
Burns. &ldquo;I got Schofield, and I&rsquo;m going to deliver
him. He&rsquo;s safe enough, don&rsquo;t you worry. When
you go back you can tell Captain Foraker that Schofield
is in perfectly good hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pleasant, amiable manner of the subaltern underwent
a quick change. He at once became the
stern, businesslike representative of the government.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry, Captain Burns, but I shall deliver
no such message, and when I go back I shall have
the criminal with me. Those are my orders, and I
intend to carry them out.&rdquo; He turned to the six
sailors sitting quietly in the boat, their oars still in
the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unship oars!&rdquo; he commanded. The sweeps
fell away, three on each side. &ldquo;Squad on deck!&rdquo;
The men scrambled up the short ladder and lined up
in two rows of three. At his belt each man carried
a revolver and cutlasses swung at their sides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; requested the officer amiably, &ldquo;will you
please lead me to the prisoner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nat&rsquo;s face darkened into a scowl of black rage,
and he cursed under his breath. It was just his luck,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
he told himself, that when he was about to triumph,
some of these government loafers should come along
and take the credit out of his hands.</p>
<p>For a moment he thought of resistance. All his
crew were on deck, drawn by curiosity. But he
saw they were vastly impressed by the discipline of
the visitors and by their decidedly warlike appearance.
If he resisted there would be blood spilt, and
he did not like the thought of that. He finally admitted
to himself that the young officer was only
carrying out orders, and orders that were absolutely
just.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, come along!&rdquo; he snarled ungraciously,
and started forward. The officer spoke a word of
command, and the squad marched after him as he, in
turn, followed Nat.</p>
<p>Of all this Code had been ignorant, for the conversation
had taken place too far aft for him to
hear. His first warning was when the sailors
marched past the window and Nat reluctantly opened
the door of the old storeroom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Officers are here to get you, Schofield,&rdquo; said the
skipper of the <i>Nettie B.</i> &ldquo;Come out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wonderingly, Code stepped into the sunlight and
open air and saw the officer with his escort. With
the resignation that he had summoned during his five
days of imprisonment he accepted his fate.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I am ready,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go as soon as
possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Schofield,&rdquo; said the subaltern, &ldquo;you are
to be transferred, and I trust you will deem it advisable
to go peaceably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catching sight of the six armed sailors, Code
could not help grinning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no question about it,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I
will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Form cordon!&rdquo; ordered the officer, and the
sailors surrounded him&ndash;&ndash;two before, two beside,
and two behind. In this order they marched to the
cutter.</p>
<p>Code was told to get in first and take a seat looking
aft. He did so, and the officer dropped into the
stern-sheets so as to face his prisoner. The sailors
took their position, shipped their oars smartly, and
the cutter was soon under way to the gunboat.</p>
<p>Arrived at the accommodation ladder, and on
deck, Code found a vessel with white decks, glistening
brass work, and discipline that shamed naval
authority. The subaltern, saluting, reported to the
deck-officer that his mission had been completed,
and the latter, after questioning Code, ordered that
he be taken to confinement quarters.</p>
<p>These quarters, unlike the pen on the <i>Nettie B.</i>,
were below the deck, but were lighted by a porthole.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
The room was larger, had a comfortable bunk, a
small table loaded with magazines, a chair, and a
sanitary porcelain washstand. The luxury of the
appointments was a revelation.</p>
<p>There was no question of his escaping from this
room he very soon discovered.</p>
<p>The door was of heavy oak and locked on the
outside. The walls were of solid, smooth timber,
and the porthole was too small to admit the possibility
of his escaping through it. The roof was
formed of the deck planks.</p>
<p>He had hardly examined his surroundings when
he heard a voice in sharp command on deck, and the
running of feet, creaking of blocks, and straining of
sheets as sail was got on the vessel. His room presently
took an acute angle to starboard, and he realized
that, with the fair gale on the quarter, they
must be crowding her with canvas.</p>
<p>He could tell by the look of the water as it flew
past his port that the remainder of the trip to St.
Andrews would not take long. He knew the course
there from his present position must be north, a little
west, across the Bay of Fundy.</p>
<p>The <i>Nettie B.</i>, when compelled to surrender her
prisoner, had rounded Nova Scotia and was on the
home-stretch toward Quoddy Roads. She was, in
fact, less than thirty miles away from Grande Mignon
Island, and Code had thought with a great and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
bitter homesickness of the joy just a sight of her
would be.</p>
<p>He longed for the white Swallowtail lighthouse
with its tin swallow above; for the tumbled green-clothed
granite of the harbor approaches; for the
black, sharp-toothed reefs that showed on the half-water
near the can-buoy, and for the procession of
stately headlands to north and south, fading from
sight in a mantle of purple and gray.</p>
<p>But most of all for the crescent of stony beach,
the nestle of white cottages along the King&rsquo;s Road,
and the green background of the mountain beyond,
with Mallaby House in the very heart of it.</p>
<p>This had been his train of thought when Burns
had opened the door to deliver him up to the gunboat,
and now it returned to him as the stanch
vessel under him winged her way across the blue
afternoon sea.</p>
<p>He wondered if the <i>Albatross</i> would pass close
enough inshore for him to get a glimpse of Mignon&rsquo;s
tall and forbidding fog-wreathed headlands.
Just a moment of this familiar sight would be balm
to his bruised spirit. He felt that he could gather
strength from the sight of home. He had been
among aliens so long!</p>
<p>But no nearer than just a glimpse. He made a
firm resolution never to push the prow of the <i>Lass</i>
into Flagg Cove until he stood clear of the charges
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
against him. He admitted that it might take years,
but his resolution was none the less strong.</p>
<p>His place of confinement was on the starboard
side of the <i>Albatross</i>, and he was gratified after a
few minutes to see the sun pouring through his porthole.</p>
<p>Despair had left him now, and he was quietly
cheerful. With something akin to pleasure that the
struggle was over, and that events were out of his
hands for the time being, he settled down in his
chair and picked up a magazine.</p>
<p>He had hardly opened it when a thought occurred
to him. If the course was north a little west, how
did it happen that the sun streamed into his room,
which was on the east side of the ship on that
course?</p>
<p>He sprang to the port and looked out.</p>
<p>The sun smote him full in the face. He strained
his eyes against the horizon that was unusually clear
for this foggy sea, and would have sworn that along
its edge was a dark line of land. The conclusion
was inevitable.</p>
<p>The <i>Albatross</i> was flying directly south as fast as
her whole spread of canvas could take her.</p>
<p>Schofield could not explain this phenomenon to
himself, nor did he try. The orders that a man-of-war
sailed under were none of his affair, and if the
captain chose to institute a hunt for the north pole
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
before delivering a prisoner in port, naturally he
had a perfect right to do so. It was possible, Code
told himself, that another miserable wretch was to
be picked up before they were both landed together.</p>
<p>Whatever course Captain Foraker intended to lay
in the future his present one was taking him as far
as possible away from Grande Mignon, St. Andrew&rsquo;s,
and St. John&rsquo;s. And for this meager comfort Code
Schofield was thankful.</p>
<p>The sun remained above the horizon until six
o&rsquo;clock, and then suddenly plumped into the sea.
The early September darkness rushed down and, as
it did so, a big Tungsten light in the ceiling of
Code&rsquo;s room sprang into a brilliant glow, the iron
cover to the porthole being shut at the same instant.</p>
<p>A few moments later the door of his cell was unceremoniously
opened and a man entered bearing
an armful of fresh clothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Schofield,&rdquo; he said, with the deference
of a servant, &ldquo;the captain wishes your presence at
dinner. The ship&rsquo;s barber will be here presently.
Etiquette provides that you wear these clothes. I
will fix them and lay them out for you. If you care
for a bath, sir, I will draw it&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, look here,&rdquo; exclaimed our hero with a sudden
and unexpected touch of asperity, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
trying to kid me, old side-whiskers, you&rsquo;re due for
the licking of your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He got deliberately upon his feet and removed
the fishing-coat which he had worn uninterruptedly
since the night at St. Pierre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d read about you in that magazine
or something, and had fallen asleep, but here you
are still in the room. I&rsquo;m going to see whether
you&rsquo;re alive or not. No one can mention a bath to
me with impunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made a sudden grab for the servant, who
stood with mouth open, uncertain as to whether or
not he was dealing with a lunatic.</p>
<p>Before he could move, Code&rsquo;s hard, strong hands
closed upon his arms in a grip that brought a bellow
of pain. In deadly fear of his life, he babbled protests,
apologies, and pleadings in an incoherent medley
that would have satisfied the most toughened
skeptic. Code released him, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess you&rsquo;re real, all right,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Now if you&rsquo;re in earnest about all this, draw that
bath <i>quick</i>. Then I&rsquo;ll believe you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half an hour later Code, bathed, shaved, and
feeling like a different man, was luxuriating in fresh
linen and a comfortable suit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Martin,&rdquo; he said to the valet, &ldquo;of
course I know that this is no more the gunboat
<i>Albatross</i> than I am. The Canadian government
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
isn&rsquo;t in the habit of treating prisoners in exactly this
manner. What boat is this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin coughed a little before answering. In
all his experience he had never before been asked
to dress the skipper of a fishing vessel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was told to say, sir, in case you asked, that
you are aboard the mystery schooner, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! The mystery schooner that led the
steamer that chase?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, by the great trawl hook! And I didn&rsquo;t
know it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir. Remember we came up behind the
<i>Nettie B.</i>, and when you were transferred you were
made to sit facing away from this ship so you would
not recognize her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then all the guns were fakes, and the whole
business of a man-of-war as well?&rdquo; cried Code,
astonished almost out of his wits by this latest development
in his fortunes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. The appearances were false, but as
for seamanship, sir, this vessel could not do what
she does were it not for the strict training aboard
her, sir. I&rsquo;ll wager our lads can out-maneuver and
outsail any schooner of her tonnage on the seas,
Gloucestermen included. The navy is easy compared
to our discipline.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what holds the men to it if it&rsquo;s so hard?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Double wages and loyalty to the captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Foraker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. There, sir, that tie is beautiful.
Now the waistcoat and coat. If you will permit
me, sir, you look, as I might say, &rsquo;andsome, begging
your pardon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Code flushed and looked into the glass that hung
against the wall of his cabin. He barely recognized
the clean-shaven, clear-eyed, broad shouldered
youth he saw there as the rough, salty skipper of
the schooner <i>Charming Lass</i>. He wondered with
a chuckle what Pete Ellinwood would say if he could
see him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, sir, if you&rsquo;re ready, just come with
me, sir. Dinner is at seven, and it is now a quarter
to the hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stunned by the wonders already experienced, and
vaguely hoping that the dream would last forever,
Code followed the bewhiskered valet down a narrow
passage carpeted with a stuff so thick that it
permitted no sound.</p>
<p>Martin passed several doors&ndash;&ndash;the passage was
lighted by small electrics&ndash;&ndash;and finally paused before
one on the right-hand side. Here he knocked,
and apparently receiving an answer, peered into the
room for a moment. Withdrawing his head, he
swung the door open and turned to Schofield.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Go right in, sir,&rdquo; he said, and Code, eager for
new wonders, stepped past him.</p>
<p>The room was a small sitting-room, lighted softly
by inverted bowl-shaped globes of glass so colored
as to bring out the full value of the pink velours and
satin brocades with which the room was hung and
the furniture covered.</p>
<p>For a moment he stared without seeing anything,
and then a slight rustling in a far corner diverted
his attention. He looked sharply and saw a woman
rise from a lounge and come toward him with outstretched
hands.</p>
<p>She was Elsa Mallaby!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>THE SIREN</h3>
</div>
<p>He saw the glad smile on her lips, the light in
her great, lustrous, dark eyes, and the
beauty of her faultless body, and yet they
all faded to nothing beside the astounding and inexplicable
fact that she was in the mystery schooner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You here!&rdquo; he gasped, taking her hands in his
big rough ones and gripping them tight. The impulse
to draw her to him in an embrace was almost
irresistible, for not only was she lovely in the extreme,
but she was from Freekirk Head and home,
and his soul had been starved with loneliness and
the ceaseless repetition of his own thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied in her gentle voice, &ldquo;I am
here. You are surprised?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That hardly expresses it,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;So
many things have happened to-day that I expect anything
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, let us go in,&rdquo; she said, and led him
through a doorway that connected with an adjoining
room. In the center of it was a small table laid
with linen and furnished with glittering silver and
glass. &ldquo;Are you hungry?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You know fishermen well enough not to ask
that,&rdquo; he laughed, and they sat down. Elsa did
not make any tax upon his conversational powers.
It was Code himself who first put a pertinent question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take for granted your being here and your living
like this,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but I am bursting with curiosity.
How do you happen to be in this schooner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my schooner; why shouldn&rsquo;t I be in it?&rdquo;
she smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yours?&rdquo; He was mystified. &ldquo;But why
should you have a vessel like this? You never used
one before that I know of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, Code; but I have always loved the sea,
and&ndash;&ndash;it amuses me. You remember that sometimes
I have been away from Freekirk Head for a
month at a time. I have been cruising in this
schooner. Once I went nearly as far as Iceland;
but that took longer. A woman in my position
must do something. I <i>can&rsquo;t</i> sit up in that great big
house alone all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The intensity with which she said this put a decidedly
new face on the matter. It was just like
her to be lonely without Jim, he thought. Naturally
a woman with all her money must do something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Elsa,&rdquo; he protested, &ldquo;your having the
schooner for your own use is all right enough; but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
why has it always turned up to help me when I
needed help most? Really, if I had all the money
in the world I could never repay the obligations that
you have put me under this summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to repay me,&rdquo; she said quietly.
&ldquo;Just the fact that I have helped you and that you
appreciate it is enough to make me happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked steadily into her brown eyes for a few
moments. Then her gaze dropped and a dull flush
mounted from her neck until it suffused her face.</p>
<p>He had never seen her look so beautiful. The
wealth of her black hair was coiled about the top
of her head like a crown, and held in its depths a
silver butterfly.</p>
<p>Her gown was Quaker gray in color, and of some
soft clinging material that enhanced the lines of
her figure. It was an evening gown, and cut just
low enough to be at the same time modest and beautiful.
Code, without knowing why, admired her
taste and told himself that she erred in no particular.
Her mode of life was, at the same time, elegant and
feminine&ndash;&ndash;exactly suited her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are easily made happy,&rdquo; he remarked, referring
to her last sentence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; she contradicted him seriously.
&ldquo;I am the hardest woman in the world to make
happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And helping me does it?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a good woman,&rdquo; he said gratefully,
&ldquo;and always seem to be doing for others. No one
will ever forget how you offered to stand by the
women of Grande Mignon while the men went fishing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Elsa blushed, but this time the color came
from a different source. Little did he know that
her philanthropy was all a part of the same plan&ndash;&ndash;to
win his favor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the things I know you must have done for
my mother,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Those are the things
that I appreciate more than any. It is not every
woman who would even think of them, let alone do
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why would he force her into this attitude of perpetual
lying? she thought. It was becoming worse
and worse. Why was he so straightforward and
so blind? Could he not see that she loved him?
Was he one of those cold and passionless men upon
whom no woman ever exerts an intense influence?</p>
<p>Though she did not know it, she expressed the
whole fault in her system. A man reared in a more
complex community than a fishing village would
have divined her scheme, and the result would have
been a prolonged but most delightful duel of wits
and hearts.</p>
<p>But Code, by the very directness of his honesty,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
and simplicity of his nature, cut through the gauzy
wrappings of this delectable package and went
straight to its heart. And there he found nothing,
because what little of the deeply genuine there lay
in this woman&rsquo;s restless nature was disguised and
shifted at the will of her caprice.</p>
<p>When Code had experienced the pleasure of lighting
a genuine clear Havana cigar after many
months of abstinence, she leaned across the table to
him, her hands clasped before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Code, what does loneliness represent to you?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he temporized, taken aback.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t go in for loneliness much; but when I do,
why all I want is&ndash;&ndash;well, let me see, a good game
of quoits with the boys in front of the church, or a
talk with my mother about how rich we are going
to be some day when I get that partnership in the
fishstand. I&rsquo;m too busy to be lonely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m too lonely to be busy!&rdquo; He looked
at her unbelievingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Why, you have everything
in the world; you can go anywhere, do anything,
have the people about you that you want. You,
lonely? I don&rsquo;t understand you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll put it another way. Did you ever
want something so hard that it hurt, and couldn&rsquo;t
get it?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I wanted my father back after he died,&rdquo;
said Code simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I wanted Jim after he died,&rdquo; added Elsa.
&ldquo;Those things are bad enough; but one gets used to
them. What I mean especially is something we see
about us all the time and have no chance of getting.
Did you ever want something like that, so that it
nearly killed you, and couldn&rsquo;t get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Code was silent. The one rankling hurt of his
whole life, after seemingly being healed, broke out
afresh&ndash;&ndash;the engagement of Nat Burns and Nellie
Tanner.</p>
<p>He suddenly realized that, since seeing Elsa, he had
not as much as remembered Nellie&rsquo;s existence, when
usually her mental presence was not far from him.
Elsa, with all her luxury and alluring feminine
charms, seemed to cast a spell that bound him helpless
like the music in the fairy stories. He liked
the spell, and, after all she had done, he confessed
to an extraordinary feeling for the enchantress.</p>
<p>Now had come the memory of Nellie&ndash;&ndash;dear,
frank-eyed, open-hearted Nellie Tanner&ndash;&ndash;and the
thought that her fresh wholesomeness was pledged
to make glad the life of Nat Burns seared his heart.
A cloud settled down on his brow. But in a moment
he recalled himself. His hostess had asked
him a question; he must answer it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have wanted something&ndash;&ndash;and couldn&rsquo;t
get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Elsa slowly, &ldquo;a thing is bad
enough; but it seems to me that the most hopeless
thing in the world is to want a person in that way.&rdquo;
Her voice was dreamy and retrospective. Its
peculiar, vibrant timbre thrilled him with the
thought that perhaps there was some hidden tragedy
in her life that he had never suspected. Any unpleasant
sense that she was curious was overcome by
the manner in which she spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is,&rdquo; he answered solemnly.</p>
<p>She looked up in astonishment at the sincerity of
his tone, her heart tingling with a new emotion of
delicious uncertainty. What if, after all, he had
wanted some one in the way she wanted him?
What if the some one were herself and he had been
afraid to aspire to a woman of her wealth and position?
She asked this without any feeling of conceit,
for one who loves always dreams he sees signs of
favor in the one beloved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you have wanted some one?&rdquo; All her
manner, her voice, her eyes expressed sympathy.
She was the soul of tact and no mean actress at the
same time.</p>
<p>Code, still in the depth of reminiscence and
averted happiness, scarcely heard her, but he answered</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have.&rdquo; Then, coming to full realization
of the confession, he colored and laughed uneasily.
&ldquo;But let&rsquo;s not talk of such personal things any
more,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;You must think me very foolish
to be mooning about like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I help you?&rdquo; she asked, half suffocated by
the question. &ldquo;Perhaps there might be something
I could do that would bring the one you want to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the crucial point in the conversation. She
held her breath as she awaited his answer. She
knew he was no adept at the half-meanings and
near-confessions of flirtation, and that she could depend
upon his words and actions to be genuine.</p>
<p>He looked at her calmly without the additional
beat of a pulse. His color had died down and left
him pale. He was considering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have done much for me,&rdquo; he said at last,
&ldquo;and I shall never forget it, but in this matter even
<i>you</i> could not help me. Only the Almighty could
do it by direct intervention, and I don&rsquo;t believe He
works that way in this century,&rdquo; Code smiled
faintly.</p>
<p>As for Elsa, she felt the grip as of an icy hand
upon her heart. It was some one else that he
meant. Was it possible that all her carefully
planned campaign had come to this miserable failure?
Had she come this far only to lose all?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span></div>
<p>The expression of her features did not change,
and she sought desperately to control her emotion,
but she could not prevent two great tears from welling
up in her eyes and slowly rolling down her
cheeks.</p>
<p>Code sat startled and nonplused. Only once before
in his life had he seen a woman cry, and
that was when Nellie broke down in his mother&rsquo;s
house after the fire. But the cause for that was
evident, and the very fact of her tears had been a
relief to him. Now, apparently without rime or
reason, Elsa Mallaby was weeping.</p>
<p>The sight went to his heart as might the scream
of a child in pain. He wondered with a panicky
feeling whether he had hurt her in any way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Elsa,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?
Don&rsquo;t do that. If I&rsquo;ve done anything&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He was
on his feet and around the little table in an instant.
He took her left hand in his left and put his right
on her shoulder, speaking to her in broken, incoherent
sentences.</p>
<p>But his words, gentle and almost endearing, emphasized
the feeling of miserable self-pity that had
taken hold of her and she suddenly sobbed aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elsa, dear,&rdquo; he cried, beside himself with uncertainty,
&ldquo;what is it? Tell me. You&rsquo;ve done so
much for me, please let me do something for you if
I can.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t, Code,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;unless it&rsquo;s in your
heart,&rdquo; and then she bowed her beautiful head forward
upon her bare arms and wept. After awhile
the storm passed and she leaned back.</p>
<p>He kissed her suddenly. Then he abruptly
turned to the door and went out.</p>
<p>Schofield had suddenly come to his senses and disengaged
himself from Elsa&rsquo;s embrace.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>THE GUILT FIXED</h3>
</div>
<p>It was the following afternoon before Code
Schofield ventured on deck.</p>
<p>When he did so it was to find that all naval
uniforms had been laid aside, the imitation brass
guns forward had been removed, and the schooner
so altered that she would scarcely have been recognized
as the <i>Albatross</i>.</p>
<p>The wireless had been erected again, and now the
apparatus was spitting forth an almost constant
series of messages. The crew, spotless in dungarees
and without a vestige of a weapon, maneuvered
the schooner as Code had never in his life
seen a vessel handled. At a word from the officer
of the watch they jumped as one man. Every order
was executed on the run, and all sails were
swayed as flat and taut as boards.</p>
<p>Code found Elsa ensconced with a book under
the awning amidships. Big, comfortable wicker
chairs were about and the deck so lately cleared for
action had an almost homelike look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you sleep well?&rdquo; asked the girl with an entire
lack of self-consciousness, as though the episode
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
of the night before had never occurred. Code was
very thankful for her tact and much relieved. It
was evident that their relations for the remainder of
the four days&rsquo; journey north were to be impersonal
unless he chose to make them otherwise. This he
had no intention of doing&ndash;&ndash;after his morning&rsquo;s
battle with himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a top, when I got started,&rdquo; he replied.
&ldquo;And you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Splendidly, thanks. And you should have seen
the breakfast I ate. I am a shameful gourmand
when I am at sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took a chair and filled his pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, how long have you been out on this
cruise? You weren&rsquo;t aboard, were you, the time
the mystery schooner led the revenue steamer such
a chase?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;but I wish I had been. I
nearly died when I heard about that; it was so funny.
I have only been aboard about four days. I&rsquo;ll tell
you the history of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was having a very delightful dinner up at
Mallaby House with Mrs. Tanner, Nellie&rsquo;s mother,
you know&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;she looked unconcernedly out to sea&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;when
I got a message, part wireless and part
telegram, saying that Nat Burns had nabbed you
in St. Pierre and was racing with you to St. Andrew&rsquo;s.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve sworn all along that you shouldn&rsquo;t
come to any harm through him, so I just left Freekirk
Head the next morning on the steamer, took a
train to Halifax, and had the schooner pick me up
there. Off Halifax they told me that the <i>Nettie
B.</i> was six hours ahead of us and going hard, so we
had to wing it out for all there was in this one. I
had provided all the naval fixings before, realizing
that we would probably have to use them some time,
and that&rsquo;s all there is to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Elsa, I&rsquo;ll say this&ndash;&ndash;that I don&rsquo;t believe
that there was ever a schooner built that could outgame
and outsail this one. She&rsquo;s a wonder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a while they talked of trite and inconsequential
things. It was very necessary that they become
firmly grounded on their new footing of genuine
friendship before departing into personalities; and
so, for two days, they avoided any but the most
casual topics.</p>
<p>As the weather was exceptionally warm, with a
spicy salt breeze that seemed to bear the very germ
of life in its midst, they had breakfast and luncheon
on deck, dining below in the rosy little dining-room.</p>
<p>Thirty-six hours before they expected to catch
the fishing fleet (it had been maneuvered so that
Code should be restored to the <i>Charming Lass</i> after
dark), Elsa opened the subject of Code&rsquo;s trouble
with Nat Burns. It was morning, and his recent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
days of ease and mental refreshment had made him
see things clearly that had before been obscured by
the great strain under which he labored.</p>
<p>Code told her the whole thing from beginning to
end, leaving out only that part of Nat&rsquo;s cumulative
scheme that had to do with Nellie Tanner. He
showed Elsa how his enemy had left no stone unturned
to bring him back home a pauper, a criminal,
and one who could never again lift his head among
his own people even though he escaped years in
prison.</p>
<p>It was a brief and simple story, but he could see
Elsa&rsquo;s face change as emotions swept over it. Her
remarks were few, but he suddenly became aware
that she was harboring a great and lasting hatred
against Nat. He did not flatter himself that it was
on his own account, nor did he ask the reason for it,
but the knowledge that such a hatred existed came
to him as a decided surprise.</p>
<p>When he had finished his narrative she sat for
some little time silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you think, then,&rdquo; she asked at last, &ldquo;that
his motive for all this is revenge, because his father
happened to meet death on the old <i>May?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far it has seemed to me that that can be
the only possible reason. What else&ndash;&ndash;but now
wait a moment while I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went below into his room, secured the old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
log of the <i>M.C. Burns</i> and the artificial horizon.
Together they read the entries that Michael Burns
had made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Elsa,&rdquo; said Code by way of explanation,
&ldquo;it was a dead-sure thing that Nat could never
have beaten me in his schooner, and for two reasons:
First, the <i>May</i> was a naturally faster boat than the
old <i>M.C.</i>, although Nat would never admit it.
That is what really started our racing. Secondly,
I am only telling the truth when I say that I can
outsail Nat Burns in any wind from a zephyr to a
typhoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is the kind of chap, in regard to sailing, who
doesn&rsquo;t seem to have the &lsquo;feel&rsquo; of the thing.
There is a certain instinct of forces and balance that
is either natural or acquired. Nat&rsquo;s is acquired.
Why, I can remember just as well when I was eight
years old my father used to let me take a short
trick at the wheel in good weather, and I took to
it naturally. Once on the Banks in a gale, when I
was only eighteen, the men below said that my trick
at the wheel was the only one when they got any
sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, those two things being the case, Elsa,
how did Nat Burns expect to win the second race
from the <i>May</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. It doesn&rsquo;t seem possible that he
<i>could</i> win.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it doesn&rsquo;t, and yet his father writes
here that Nat &lsquo;swears he can&rsquo;t lose.&rsquo; Well, now,
you know, a man that swears he can&rsquo;t lose is pretty
positive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he try to bet with you for the second
race?&rdquo; asked Elsa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he? I had five hundred dollars at the
bank and he tried to bet me that. I never bet, because
I&rsquo;ve never had enough money to throw it
around. A good deal changed hands on the first
race, but none of it was mine. I raced for sport
and not for money, and I told Nat so when he tried
to bet with me. If I had raced for money I couldn&rsquo;t
have withdrawn that day and gone to St. John for
cargo the way I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it seems to me that he must have <i>known</i>
he couldn&rsquo;t lose or he would not have tried to bet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how <i>could</i> he know it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what I would like to find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Code absently thrust his hand into his coat pocket
and encountered the mirror he had found aboard
the <i>Nettie B.</i> He drew it out and polished its
bright surface with his handkerchief.</p>
<p>Elsa was immediately interested and Code told
her of its unexpected discovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he had it!&rdquo; she cried, laughing. &ldquo;Of all
things!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and he always wanted it. I remember
when father first gave it to me and I was working
out little problems in astronomy, Nat used to take
the thing and handle it and admire it. You see the
back and edges are silver-plated and it is really quite
valuable. He tried to get his father interested, but,
so far as I know, never succeeded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a strange thing, but that simple mirror
appealed to Nat tremendously, and you know how
that would act on a man of his nature. He is and
always has been utterly selfish, and if there was any
object he wanted and could not have it increased
his desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did he get it, I wonder?&rdquo; asked the
girl, taking the object and heliographing the bright
sun&rsquo;s rays from the polished surface. &ldquo;When did
you have it last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Code knitted his brows and thought back carefully.
He had an instinctive feeling that perhaps in
this mirror lay the key to the whole situation, just
as often in life the most unexpected and trivial
things or events are pregnant with great moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had it,&rdquo; he said slowly, thinking hard; &ldquo;let
me see: the last time I remember it was the day
after my first race with Nat. In the desk that stood
in the cabin of the old <i>May</i> I kept the log, my sextant,
and a lot of other things of that kind. In a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
lower drawer was this mirror, and the reason I saw
it was this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I had made fast to my moorings in the
harbor I immediately went below to make the entry
in the log about the race&ndash;&ndash;naturally I couldn&rsquo;t
leave that undone. I remember I looked in the top
drawer for the book, but didn&rsquo;t find it. So then
I looked in the other drawers and, in doing so,
opened the one containing the mirror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I distinctly remember seeing it, for the lamp
was lighted and the glass flashed a blinding glare
into my eyes. You see we raced in about the worst
winter weather there was and the lamp had to be
lighted very early.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The log-book wasn&rsquo;t there, and I found it somewhere
or other later, but that hasn&rsquo;t anything to do
with the case. I never saw the mirror after that&ndash;&ndash;in
fact, never looked for it. I took for granted it
had gone down with the <i>May</i>, along with all my
other things, except the log-book, which I saved and
use now aboard the <i>Lass</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you didn&rsquo;t take it out or give it to anybody?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I am positive of that. I didn&rsquo;t touch
it after seeing it that once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it is very plain, Code, that if Nat Burns
came into possession of it he must have taken it himself.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
He was very angry with you for winning,
wasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Terribly. For once I thought he might be dangerous
and kept out of his way until the thing had
worn off a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just like him,&rdquo; said Elsa in that tone of bitter
hatred that Code had heard her use before when
speaking of Burns. &ldquo;He must have gone aboard
the <i>May</i> and taken it, because you prized it so much.
A fine revenge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but we don&rsquo;t do those things in Freekirk
Head, Elsa. You know that. We don&rsquo;t steal
from one another&rsquo;s trawl-lines, and we don&rsquo;t prowl
about other men&rsquo;s schooners. I can&rsquo;t understand
his doing a thing like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not, but if not, explain how he got
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Code admitted after a moment&rsquo;s
thought; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the only way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were silent for a while, pondering over this
new development and trying to discover where it
might lead. Under sharp commands the crew
brought the schooner about on the starboard tack,
for the wind was on the bow, and set a staysail between
the fore and main masts. The splendid ship
seemed to skim over the surface of the sea, touching
only the tops of the waves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s no good!&rdquo; broke out Code suddenly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
&ldquo;Much as I hate Nat Burns, I don&rsquo;t believe he
would come aboard my schooner just for the purpose
of stealing a silver-plated mirror. That isn&rsquo;t
like him. He&rsquo;s too clever to do anything like that.
And, besides, what kind of a revenge would that be
for having lost the race?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what can you suggest? How else did
he get it?&rdquo; Elsa was frankly sceptical and clung
to her own theory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might have come aboard for something else,
mightn&rsquo;t he, and picked up the mirror just incidentally?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might have, yes, but what else would bring
him there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Code sat rigid for a few minutes. He had such
a thought that he scarcely dared consider it himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all clear to me now,&rdquo; he said in a low, hoarse
voice. &ldquo;Nat came aboard to damage the schooner
so that he would be sure to win the second race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Code!&rdquo; The cry was one of involuntary horror
as Elsa remembered the tragedy of the <i>May</i>.
Hate Nate though she might, this was an awful
charge to lay at his door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he killed his own father, if what you say
is true!&rdquo; she added breathlessly. &ldquo;Oh, the poor
wretch! The poor wretch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that solves it,&rdquo; went on Code, who had
hardly heard her. &ldquo;That solves the entries that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
Michael Burns made in his ship&rsquo;s log before he went
to St. John on his last business trip. Nat swore he
could not lose, and the old man, who was honest
enough himself, must have wondered what his son
was up to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This mirror proves that Nat must have been
aboard the schooner secretly; what he told his father
and his eagerness to bet with me on a proposition
that seemed foolhardy on the face of it clinch the
thing in my mind. The misguided fool! That,
Elsa, is an example of how low a man will go who
has been spoiled and brought up without the slightest
idea of self-control.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re preaching to me, Code,&rdquo; laughed
the girl, and he joined her. But she sobered in a
moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is all very fine theory,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I
half believe it myself, but it&rsquo;s worthless; you haven&rsquo;t
a grain of proof. Tell me, have you ever thought
over the details of the sinking of the <i>May?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only once,&rdquo; groaned Schofield, &ldquo;and I&ndash;&ndash;I hate
to do it, Elsa. I&rsquo;d rather not. Every time I think
of that awful day I sweat with sheer horror. Every
incident of it is engraved on my brain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But listen, Code, you must think about it for
once, and think about it with all your mind. Tell
me everything that happened. It is vital to our
case; it may save the whole thing from being worthless.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
Even if we get nothing you must make the
effort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Code knew that what Elsa said was true. With
an effort he focused his mind back on that awful day
and began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a good sea that day,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
more than half a gale out of the northeast. If it
had been any other day I shouldn&rsquo;t have taken the
old <i>May</i> out at all, because she was loaded very
deep. But the whole trip was a hurry call and they
wanted me to get back to Mignon with the salt as
soon as I could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Burns saw me on the wharf and asked if he
could go along as passenger. I said he could, and
we started early in the morning. Now that day
wasn&rsquo;t anything unusual, Elsa. I&rsquo;ve been in a lot
worse gales in the <i>May</i>, but not with her so deep;
but I didn&rsquo;t think anything would happen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything went all right for three hours, with
the wind getting fresher all the time, and the vessel
under four lowers, which was a pretty big strain on
any schooner. As I say, she should have stood it,
but all of a sudden, on a big lurch, the fore topm&rsquo;st
that hadn&rsquo;t a rag on her broke off short and banged
down, hanging by the guys. With one swipe it
smashed the foregaff to splinters, and half the canvas
hung down flapping like a great wing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t understand it. I knew the topm&rsquo;st
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
was in a weakened condition, but not as rotten as
punk, and I supposed my foregaff was as solid a
piece of timber as ever went into a vessel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But listen!&rdquo; as Elsa started to speak. &ldquo;That
isn&rsquo;t all. The flapping canvas, with part of the
gaff, pounded around like the devil let loose for the
ten seconds before we couldn&rsquo;t loosen the halyards
and lower away the wreckage, but in that time it
had parted the mainstay in two like a woman snipping
a thread.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind that, Elsa, a steel mainstay an inch thick.
I never heard of one parting in my life before.
Things were happening so fast that I couldn&rsquo;t keep
track of them, and now, just at the crucial minute,
the old <i>May</i> jibed, fell off from the wind, and went
into the trough of the sea. A great wave came
then, ripped her rudder off (I found this as soon as
I tried to use the wheel) and swept the decks, taking
one man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile the mainmast, with one stay gone,
was whipping from side to side like a great, loose
stick. I put the wheel in the becket and in one jump
released the mains&rsquo;l throat-halyards, while another
fellow released the peak. The sail came down on
the run in the lazy jacks and the men jumped on it
and began to crowd it into some kind of a furl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I jumped back to the wheel and tried to bring
her up into the wind, but I might as well have tried
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
to steer an ocean liner with a sculling sweep. Not
only was her rudder gone, but the tiller ropes were
parted on each side. It was damaged beyond repair!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once I read in school the funny poem of an
American named Holmes. It was called the &lsquo;One
Hoss Shay,&rsquo; and it told about an old chaise that,
after a hundred years of service, suddenly went to
pieces all at the same time and the same place.
Even, in that time of danger, the memory of the
&lsquo;One Hoss Shay&rsquo; came to me, and I thought that
the <i>May Schofield</i> was doing exactly the same thing,
although only half as old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then what happened?&rdquo; asked Elsa, who
had sat breathless through Code&rsquo;s narrative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not much more to tell,&rdquo; he said, with
an involuntary shudder. &ldquo;It was too much for the
old girl with that load in her. She began to wallow
and drive toward the Wolves that I had caught a
glimpse of through the scud. She hadn&rsquo;t got halfway
there when the mainmast came down (bringing
nearly everything with it) and hung over the
starboard quarter, dragging the vessel down like a
stoat hanging to a duck&rsquo;s leg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After that it was easy to see she was doomed.
We chopped away at the tangle of wreckage whenever
we got a chance, but that wasn&rsquo;t often, because,
in her present position, the waves raked her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
every second and we had to hang on for dear life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then she began to go to pieces&ndash;&ndash;which
was the beginning of the end. All hands knew it
was to be every man for himself. We had no life
preservers, and our one big dory had been smashed
when the wreckage came down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Code&rsquo;s face was working with suppressed emotion,
and Elsa reached out her hand and touched
his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me any more,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I know the
rest. Let&rsquo;s talk about the present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Elsa,&rdquo; he said, gratefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long have you thought that the schooner
was a second &lsquo;one hoss shay&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until this talk with you. I would never have
thought anything else. It&rsquo;s the logical thing to
think, isn&rsquo;t it? All my neighbors at Freekirk Head,
except those who believe the evil they hear, have
told me half a dozen times that that is what must
have happened to the <i>May</i>. She had lived her life
and that last great strain, combined with the race
the week before, was too much for her. I simply
could not explain those things happening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you can now, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she asked
coolly.</p>
<p>Reluctantly he faced the issue, but he faced it
squarely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can. Nat expected me to sail the <i>May</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
in a race, so he weakened my topm&rsquo;st and mainstay.
Of course, when there is sport in it you set every
kite you&rsquo;ve got in your lockers and, you know, Elsa,
I never took my mains&rsquo;l in yet while there was one
standing in the fleet, even ordinary fishing days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it; you&rsquo;ve scared me half to death a
dozen times with your sail-carrying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And mind, Elsa, I&rsquo;d been warned by all the
wiseacres in Freekirk Head that my sticks would
carry away sometime in a gale o&rsquo; wind. Nat
banked on that, too, and it shows how clever he was,
forever since the <i>May</i> sank I&rsquo;ve had men tell
me I shouldn&rsquo;t have carried four lowers that
day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He planned to weaken me where I needed sail
most and he succeeded. Why, Elsa, that topm&rsquo;st
must have been sawed a quarter of the way through
and that mainstay as much again. I don&rsquo;t really
believe he did anything to the foregaff; it appeared
to be the natural result of the topm&rsquo;st&rsquo;s falling, but
the damage he did resulted in the wreck of the
schooner&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the death of his own father. Yes, Code,
we&rsquo;ve got him where he is probably the wretchedest
man in the world. Fury and hurt pride made him
injure the <i>May</i> so he would be sure to win the second
time, and instead of that fate intervened, sent
you on the cargo voyage, and killed his father.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
Now it is perfectly plain to me why he is charging
you with all these crimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nat is a weak nature, because uncontrolled, and
when weak natures do wrong they suffer agonies of
fear that they will be found out. Nat committed
this double crime in a momentary passion. Then as
the weeks passed by and the village talked of nothing
else, he finally began to fear that he would be
found out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no one who <i>could</i> have found him out,
but there was that haunting terror of the weak nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody spoke a word, perhaps in jest, that
you must have wanted a new schooner since the
<i>May&rsquo;s</i> policy was to run out so soon, and he seized
the thought in a frenzy of joy and began to spread
rumors. This grip on you gave him courage. He
remembered that his revenge against you was still
unsatisfied and it became clear to him that perhaps,
after all, he could get one much more complete.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Code, the picture of that man&rsquo;s mind is a terrible
one to me. He may have hated you before, but just
think how he must have hated you after knowing
how he had wronged and was going to ruin you. It
is only the one of two people who <i>does</i> the injury
whose hatred grows. An injured person who is
sensible in regard to such matters, as you have been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
with Nat all your life, throws them off and thinks
nothing more about them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Nat&rsquo;s hatred of you and the fear of discovery,
preying on his mind, finally urged him into the
course he has taken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he went into it with open eyes,&rdquo; rejoined
Code, &ldquo;for his plans were perfect. He pays his
crew double wages and they ask no questions. Had
it not been for you on two occasions I should have
been in jail long before this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but now that is past&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; interrupted Code, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t, Elsa. He has
just as much power over me as he ever had. I am
still a criminal at large to be arrested, and you can
wager your last dollar that if he can bring it about I
will be picked up by the first gunboat that finds me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But after all this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, after all this. We have made a beautiful
case against him and it fits, but, Elsa, there&rsquo;s one
thing we haven&rsquo;t got, and that is a single word of
proof! We haven&rsquo;t enough to even bring a charge
against him. Do you realize that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl sat back, unable to reply. Code had
expressed the situation in a sentence. Despite all
they had pieced together he, Code, was still the man
against whom the burden of circumstantial evidence
rested. Nat was, and always could go, scot free.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Code, this is terrible!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
may be a way out yet. No man with the right on
his side has ever failed to triumph, however black
things looked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how?&rdquo; he cried despairingly. &ldquo;I have
racked my brains for some means of closing the net
about him, but there seems no way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now there is not,&rdquo; she returned, &ldquo;but, Code, you
can rest assured that I will do everything I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless you,&rdquo; he said, taking her hand; &ldquo;you
are the best friend a man ever had.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>WETTING THEIR SALT</h3>
</div>
<p>Pete Ellinwood, alone except for the
cook, who sat peeling potatoes just outside
the galley, paced the quarter-deck of the
<i>Charming Lass</i>.</p>
<p>He seemed to be an older man than that night
when, goaded beyond endurance by the taunts of
the big Frenchman, he had fought a fight that would
long be remembered in the streets of the roaring
town of St. Pierre.</p>
<p>He felt that he had broken his promise to Ma
Schofield that he would keep guard over her boy.
Now, for all he knew, that boy was lying in jail at
St. Andrew&rsquo;s, or was perhaps defending his life in
the murderer&rsquo;s pen.</p>
<p>The night of the fight had been a wild one for
Ellinwood.</p>
<p>At the cry of &ldquo;Police!&rdquo; the crowd had seemed to
melt away from him like the bank fog at the sweep
of a breeze. A dozen comrades had seized the
prostrate Jean and hurried him away, and Pete, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
the instinct of self-preservation, had snatched up his
clothes and dodged down a dark alley toward the
dirty drinking-shops along the water-front.</p>
<p>There, as he dressed himself, he first asked the
question, &ldquo;Where is Code?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, in a frenzy of remorse, he returned to the
street and began a wild and fruitless search all night.
Then he accidentally learned that the <i>Nettie B.</i> had
been in port two days and that her crew had been
ashore on the night of the fracas.</p>
<p>Sorrowful, bedraggled, and bruised, he rowed out
to the <i>Charming Lass</i> just as the whole crew was
setting out for shore to search for Code and himself.</p>
<p>During the night the barrels of fresh bait had
been lightered to the <i>Lass</i>, and there was nothing
for it but to make sail and get back on the Banks
as soon as possible, leaving Code to his fate but
carrying on the work he had begun.</p>
<p>In accordance with Code&rsquo;s instructions, Pete automatically
became the skipper of the schooner, and
he selected Jimmie Thomas as his mate. By nightfall
they had picked up the fleet, and early the next
morning the dories were out. Then for eight days
it had been nothing but fish, fish, fish.</p>
<p>Never in all his experience had Pete seen such
schools of cod. They were evidently herding together
in thousands, and had found but scanty food
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
for such great hosts, for they bit almost on the bare
hook.</p>
<p>Now, as he looked around the still sea, the white
or yellow sails of the fishing fleet showed on all sides
in a vast circle. Not five miles away was the <i>Rosan</i>,
and to the southward of her the <i>Herring Bone</i> with
mean old Jed Martin aboard. Bijonah Tanner had
tried his best to shake Martin, but the hard-fisted
old skipper, knowing and recognizing Tanner&rsquo;s
&ldquo;nose&rdquo; for fish, had clung like a leech and profited
by the other&rsquo;s sagacity.</p>
<p>Nor was this all the Grande Mignon fleet.</p>
<p>There were Gloucestermen among it, the champion
fishers of the world, who spent their spare
time in drifting past the English boats and hurling
salty wit&ndash;&ndash;at which pastime they often came off
second best.</p>
<p>There were Frenchmen, too, from the Miquelon
Islands, who worked in colored caps and wore
sheath-knives in belts around their waists. Pete
often looked over their dirty decks and wondered if
his late enemy were among them. There were also
vessels called &ldquo;toothpicks&rdquo; that did an exclusive
trawling business, never using dories except to
underrun the trawls or to set them out. These vessels
were built on yacht lines and, because they filled
their holds quickly, made quick runs to port with
their catches, thus getting in several trips in a season.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span></div>
<p>Also, there were the steam trawlers, the most progressive
of the fleet, owned and operated by huge
fish firms in Boston or Portland. These were not
dependent on the vagaries of the wind and steamed
wherever their skippers divined that fish might be.</p>
<p>Last of all were the seiners after herring and
mackerel, schooners mostly, and out of Gloucester
or Nova Scotia ports, who secured their catch by
encircling schools of fish that played atop of the
water with nets a quarter of a mile long, and pursued
them in by drawstrings much as a man closes
a tobacco-pouch.</p>
<p>This was the cosmopolitan city that lived on the
unmarked lanes of the ocean and preyed upon the
never-failing supplies of fish that moved beneath.</p>
<p>Among the Grande Mignon boats there was intense
rivalry. In the holds the layers of salted fish
rose steadily under the phenomenal fishing. The
salt-barrels were emptied and crowded out by the
cod, hake, and pollock. It was these boats that
Ellinwood watched with the eye of a hawk, for
back in Freekirk Head he knew that Bill Boughton
stood ready to pay a bonus for the first cargo to
reach port. Now was the time when the advance
orders from the West Indies were coming up, and,
because of the failure of the season on the island itself,
these orders stood unfilled.</p>
<p>One or two of the smallest sloops had already wet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
their salt and weighed anchor for home, taking letters
and messages; but these, Pete knew, could only
supply an infinitesimal portion of the demand.
What Boughton looked for was a healthy load of
fifteen hundred to two thousand quintals all ready
for drying.</p>
<p>Night and day the work went on. With the first
signs of daylight the dories were swung outboard
and the men took their positions. A catch of two
hundred good-sized cod was now considered the
usual thing for a handliner, and night after night
the piles of silver fish in the pens amidships seemed
to grow in size.</p>
<p>Now they dressed down under lantern light, sometimes
aided by the moon, and the men stood to the
tables until they fell asleep on their feet and split
their fingers instead of the fish. Then, after buckets
of hot coffee, they would fall to again and never
stop until the last wet body had been laid atop of
its thousands of brothers.</p>
<p>The men were constantly on the trawls. Sometimes
they did nothing all day but pick the fish and
rebait, finding, after a trip to the schooner to unload,
that a thousand others had struck on the long lines
of sagging hooks while they were gone.</p>
<p>It was fast and feverish work, and it seemed as
though it would never end.</p>
<p>The situation had resolved itself into a race between
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
the schooners, and Ellinwood was of no mind
to come off second best. Like a jockey before a
race, he watched his rivals.</p>
<p>He knew that foxy Bijonah Tanner, who sometimes
looked like an old hump-backed cod himself,
was his most dangerous rival. Tanner said nothing,
but his boats were out early and in late, and the
lanterns on his deck over the dressing pens could
sometimes be seen as late as ten o&rsquo;clock at night.</p>
<p>Visits among the fleet had now ceased, both because
there was no time for it, and because a man
from another schooner was looked upon as a spy.</p>
<p>At the start of the season it had been expected
that Nat Burns in the <i>Nettie B.</i> would prove a
strong contender for premier honors, but, because
of his ceaseless efforts to drive home his revenge,
Nat had done very little fishing and therefore could
not possibly be in the market.</p>
<p>Other Freekirk Head men shrugged their shoulders
at this. Nat had the money, and could act
that way if it pleased him, they said. But, nevertheless,
he lost favor with a great many of his
former friends, for the reason that the whole fishing
expedition had been a concerted movement to save
the people and credit of the island, and not an exploitation
of individual desires.</p>
<p>Burns had, with his customary indifference to others,
made it just exactly such an exploitation, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
sentiment that had been strong for him at the outset
of the cruise was now turning decidedly the other
way; although he little guessed this or would have
been influenced had he done so.</p>
<p>In reality, then, the race for fish was keenest between
the <i>Charming Lass</i>, the <i>Rosan</i>, and the <i>Herring
Bone</i>, with three other schooners very close on
their heels.</p>
<p>At the end of the nine days there was little space
beneath the deck planks of the <i>Charming Lass</i>, but
every night Pete would come up, slapping his hands
free of salt, and say, &ldquo;Wal, boys, I guess we can
crowd another day&rsquo;s work into her,&rdquo; and the exhausted
men would gather themselves for another
great effort as they rolled forward into their bunks.</p>
<p>Every twenty-four hours they did crowd another
day&rsquo;s work into her, so that she carried nearly a
hundred and fifty tons and the dripping brine had to
be pumped out of the hold.</p>
<p>It was the night of the day that opened this chapter.</p>
<p>The lanterns by which the men had dressed down
had been lifted from their supports, the cod livers
dumped into the gurry-butt, and the tables removed
from the rails. The two men on the first watch were
sharpening the splitting knives on a tiny grindstone
and walking forward occasionally to see that the
anchor and trawl buoy lights were burning.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span></div>
<p>The still air resounded with the snores of the exhausted
men forward in the forecastle.</p>
<p>Silently out of the darkness a dory came toward
the schooner, pulled by the brawny arms of two men.
In the stern of the oncoming boat sat a solitary figure,
who strained his eyes toward his destination.</p>
<p>The dory was within fifty yards of the <i>Lass</i> before
the men on deck became aware of its approach.
Then, fearing some evil work in connection with the
last desperate days of fishing, they rushed to the bulwarks
and challenged the newcomers. They did
not see, a mile away, a schooner without lights gently
rising and falling on the oily sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; demanded one man, but he received
no answer except &ldquo;A friend,&rdquo; and the boat
continued its stealthy approach. It drew alongside
the ladder in the waist, and the man in the stern-sheets
rose. Kent of the <i>Lass&rsquo;s</i> crew leaned over
the side and threw the light of his lantern upon the
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By God,&rdquo; he cried like one who has seen a
ghost, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the skipper.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>THE REWARD OF EVIL</h3>
</div>
<p>The <i>Nettie B.</i> was surging north, nearing
Cape Breton. Nat Burns sat moodily on
the top of the house and watched the
schooner take &rsquo;em green over her bows.</p>
<p>Within the last day a fog with a wind behind it
had drifted across the lead-colored ocean; and now,
although the fog was gone, the wind was still howling
and bringing with it a rising sea.</p>
<p>The equinoxes were not far off, and all skippers
had a weather eye out, and paid especial attention
to the stoutness of lashings and patched canvas.</p>
<p>Never had Burns been in a blacker mood, and
never had he better cause.</p>
<p>He was three days from St. Andrew&rsquo;s, and there
he had become acquainted with several facts.</p>
<p>The first was that no Canadian gunboat by the
name of <i>Albatross</i> had called at said port and left
any prisoner by the name of Code Schofield&ndash;&ndash;in
fact, such gunboat had not called at all.</p>
<p>Investigation at the admiralty office proved to
Nat that the real <i>Albatross</i> had reported from St.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
John&rsquo;s, Newfoundland, on the very day he supposed
he had met her. As the waters near St. Andrew&rsquo;s
and St. John&rsquo;s are several hundreds of miles apart,
Nat was not long in forming the opinion that he
had been duped.</p>
<p>Fuming with rage, he began to investigate.
Gradually he learned the story (from sailors in
wine-shops and general hearsay) of the mysterious
schooner that had twice saved Code Schofield from
actual capture, and had aided him on one or two
other occasions.</p>
<p>One man said he had heard of a retired naval officer
named Foraker, who was supposed to be in command.
As a matter of fact, there was a Captain
Foraker aboard the schooner who navigated her
and instilled the &ldquo;run and jump&rdquo; discipline that
had so excited Code&rsquo;s admiration. Outside of this
vague fact, Nat&rsquo;s knowledge was scant.</p>
<p>He was ignorant of who owned the swift vessel.
He would never have connected Elsa Mallaby with
her in ten years of hard thinking. All he did know
was that some unknown agency was suddenly at
work in behalf of the man he hated.</p>
<p>He notified the admiralty that a strange schooner
had impersonated the gunboat of H. I. M. George
V, and gave a very accurate description of her.</p>
<p>As this was a new offense for the vessel that had
already interfered with justice twice, the skippers of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
all the revenue cutters along the coast bent their energies
to capturing or sinking this semipiratical craft,
upon the receipt of radiograms to that effect.</p>
<p>Not only had Nat set the machinery of the law in
motion against the mystery schooner, but he had
provided against any future dabbling with his constabulary
powers by the simple expedient of having
with him an officer of the law who was empowered
to bring the accused murderer of Michael Burns before
the bar of justice without transfer.</p>
<p>When the supposed gunboat had removed the
prisoner from his deck and borne away (for a while)
on the course to St. Andrew&rsquo;s, Nat, relieved of responsibility,
ran over to Grande Mignon and into
the harbor of Freekirk Head.</p>
<p>His purpose in this was twofold, and treacherous
in both cases. First he lost no time in spreading
the details of how Code Schofield had been captured
in a drunken brawl at St. Pierre and was fighting
the jailers in St. Andrew&rsquo;s. Secondly, he had a
long private interview with Bill Boughton, in which
he tried to get the storekeeper to sign a contract
for his (Burns&rsquo;s) fish at a certain price.</p>
<p>While the former was meanness of a hideous kind,
this latter move was one of treachery against the
men of Freekirk Head. The worst part of it was
that Nat had about a hundred quintals of splendid-looking
cod (every pound he had caught) in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
hold, and these he handed over to Boughton as a
sample of what was to come from him very shortly.</p>
<p>Boughton was hard up for fish, for none had come
from the Banks, and bought them at a big price.
But as to the signing of the contract, he demurred.
When Nat could not explain why he had caught so
few fish in such a long time, the storekeeper became
wary and refused to commit himself. Finally he
agreed to the price if Nat would deliver a thousand
quintals before any of the rest of the fleet arrived
home.</p>
<p>Consequently it was up mainsail and sway &rsquo;em
flat and a fast run north for the <i>Nettie B.</i></p>
<p>During his day&rsquo;s stay in Freekirk Head he had received
a great bag of mail for the men of the fleet
from their women-folk at home, and this he had in
his cabin, now all distributed and tied into bundles,
one for each schooner, so that they could be easily
sorted and thrown aboard as he met them.</p>
<p>Burns caught the fleet of a Thursday morning, just
as they had dropped anchors after making a night
berth, and the dories were out sampling the ground
and the fish. It was just three days after Code had
arrived aboard the <i>Charming Lass</i> again.</p>
<p>As Nat worked his way in and out among the vessels,
throwing their mail aboard attached to pieces
of coal, he kept an eye out for the <i>Rosan</i>. One very
important piece of business that had brought him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
North was a reconciliation with Nellie Tanner, and
he meant, while his men were out in the dories, to
accomplish this first.</p>
<p>At last he sighted her near the very front line of
the fleet. The <i>Charming Lass</i> he could not see, for
Code had taken a different direction from the <i>Rosan</i>,
and was one of the score of sails scattered around
the horizon. But Nat was in no great hurry to get
him on the minute; if the mystery schooner
were attended to, then it would be merely a matter
of time until the capture of Code.</p>
<p>He ranged up astern of the <i>Rosan</i> with a cheery
yell and let go his anchor, ordering the dories over
the side in the same breath. But his aspirations received
a chilling setback from none other than Bijonah
Tanner himself. The old man had been
sleepless for a week, trying to nose out the <i>Lass</i> for
the top haul of the fleet, and here was a young scapegrace
who came and cast anchor within a hundred
yards of his chosen ground.</p>
<p>Nat laughed carelessly at the storm of abuse that
rattled over the stern of the <i>Rosan</i> and rowed over
to her in his dory with the package of mail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget it, papa,&rdquo; he said, easily insolent, as he
climbed over the rail in the teeth of a broadside.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not goin&rsquo; to foul your rodin&rsquo; or steal your
fish. I&rsquo;ve just come to make a call and tell you the
news from home.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span></div>
<p>He handed Bijonah a couple of letters and a package
containing those of the men. Two others he kept in
his hand.</p>
<p>For a few moments he chatted with the old man,
telling him what had happened in Freekirk Head.
Then he asked for Nellie, whom he had not seen.
As he asked she came up out of the cabin, having
just finished breakfast.</p>
<p>She was dressed in white this morning; a white
canvas blouse with a broad blue collar and V-neck
held to modest stricture by a flowing blue tie, a
white duck skirt and whitened shoes&ndash;&ndash;a costume
that set off her pink cheeks and bright eyes.</p>
<p>Since the violent emotions of the fire at the Head,
her courtship, and her self-analyzation since her
split with Nat, she had seemed to become more of a
woman.</p>
<p>Nat had not the slightest doubt but that Nellie by
this time would have recovered from her angry pet
of their last interview. He was very certain that
their ruction had only been temporary.</p>
<p>Nellie was unfeignedly glad to see him.</p>
<p>He stretched out his arms to her impulsively, but
she refused him, and he laughed the rebuff off good-naturedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, did you bring any letters for me?&rdquo; she
cried eagerly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span></div>
<p>He held out the two he had kept in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, goodness, Nat&ndash;&ndash;only from mama and
Lutie Bissell. You excited me so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spread a tarpaulin amid the clutter amidships
and they sat down.</p>
<p>She excused herself and began to read her letters,
first opening the one from the girl friend, which,
as such letters usually do, contained nothing of importance.
Then she opened the one from her
mother. It was long, and she settled back to the
pleasure of deciphering it.</p>
<p>Nat smoked and whistled and looked out to sea,
waiting for her to finish. Therefore he did not observe
the changes that passed across her face. Near
the middle of the letter the color rose to her forehead
in a hot wave, but at the end it had receded,
leaving her pale. Methodically she folded the letter
and returned it to its envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, dearest,&rdquo; he said cheerfully, &ldquo;all
through? Now I want to talk to you&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He
reached for her hand, but she withdrew it beyond
his reach and looked at him with the steady brown
eyes whose level gaze he hated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, now, Nellie,&rdquo; he said impatiently,
stung by her relentlessness, &ldquo;you ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to be
mad forever about that other time, are you? I was
out of temper an&rsquo; said things&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Mother was up to Mallaby House for dinner a
little while ago,&rdquo; interrupted Nellie, as though she
had not heard him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes? That&rsquo;s good. Fine place, ain&rsquo;t it? As
I was sayin&rsquo;, I forgot myself&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They talked about us, too; mother says that&rsquo;s
nearly all they talked about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must&rsquo;ve been short of conversation. An&rsquo; I
want to say, Nellie, that I&rsquo;ll try never to speak like
that to you again. I&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother says she learned things about you that
she never had imagined before,&rdquo; persisted Nellie,
with quiet insistence. But again Nat did not seem
to have heard her. With an awkward motion he
drew from his pocket the little glazed paper box
that contained the engagement-ring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I want you to take this
again.&rdquo; He was in earnest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange Elsa Mallaby should be able to tell
mother things about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nat lost his patience. He had tried his best to
make peace, and the girl was only baiting him for
her own amusement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the deuce is all this about that Mallaby
woman?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I should think you&rsquo;d listen
to me, Nellie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will listen to me first, then I&rsquo;ll listen to
you as long as you like.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I agree,&rdquo; he said, thrusting the ring-box back
into his pocket, &ldquo;only make it short, will you, little
girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will,&rdquo; she promised, without smiling. &ldquo;I
merely said that mother and Mrs. Mallaby had discussed
you and me, and our marriage, and that Mrs.
Mallaby had said some things about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, lots of people do that,&rdquo; he smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;but they haven&rsquo;t said just this thing,
Nat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to let you think. Just suppose that
Mrs. Mallaby hated you very much and wanted to
do you harm. What would she tell my mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl, pale and on the verge of an hysterical
outburst, watched his face out of her mask of self-control.</p>
<p>The blood beneath his tan receded and was replaced
by a sickly greenish hue. That flash had
brought its memory&ndash;&ndash;a memory that had lain buried
beneath the events of his later life. Did she
know? How could she know?</p>
<p>To the girl watching him there was confirmation
enough. She was suddenly filled with inexpressible
distaste for this man who had in days past smothered
her with caresses and dinned into her ears speeches
concerning a passion that he called love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see it is all true,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;This
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
is all I have to say. Now I will listen to what you
were going to tell me a few minutes ago&ndash;&ndash;that is,
if you still wish to say it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nat read his doom in those few calm words.
The things that had been in his mind to say rose and
choked his throat; the thought of the ring in his
pocket seemed like profanation. He gulped twice
and tried to speak, but the words clotted on his
tongue.</p>
<p>Still she sat quietly looking at him, politely ready
to listen.</p>
<p>With a horrible croaking sound he got to his feet,
looked irresolutely at her for a moment, and then
went to the side where his dory lay. She next saw
him rowing dazedly to the <i>Nettle B.</i>, and then she
turned her face from the sight of him.</p>
<p>And suddenly into her mind, long prepared, came
the thought of Code Schofield. Amid the chaos of
her shattered ideals his face and figure rose more desirable
than all the earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Heaven, give him to me&ndash;&ndash;some time!&rdquo;
she breathed in a voice of humble prayer.</p>
<p>Nat Burns went back to his schooner, squarely defeated
for the first time in his life. Humbled, and
cringing like a whipped dog, he made his dory fast
to the <i>Nettie&rsquo;s</i> rail and slunk aft to the solitude of
his cabin. He was glad that even the cook was looking
the other way.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;She has flouted me, and the whole of Grande
Mignon will know it,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;Then
they will want to know why, but that is easy enough
to lie about. Hang that Mallaby woman! Who
would ever think she&rsquo;d squeal? Yes, and Schofield,
the smug crook! They&rsquo;re the two that are doin&rsquo; the
damage to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nat&rsquo;s lifelong knowledge of Code&rsquo;s and Nellie&rsquo;s
affection returned to him now with a more poignant
pang of memory than he had ever experienced.
With the hopeless egotism of a totally selfish nature,
he laid his calamity in love to activity on Code&rsquo;s
part. He was pretty well aware of Elsa&rsquo;s extravagant
favoritism of Code, and he immediately figured
that Code had enlisted Elsa on his side to the ruin
of Nat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve got to beat &rsquo;em all now, have I?&rdquo; he
asked grimly, his jaw setting with an ugly click.
&ldquo;Schofield and Mallaby, and&ndash;&ndash;yes&ndash;&ndash;while I&rsquo;m
about it, Tanner, too. The old man never liked
me, the girl hates me, and I wouldn&rsquo;t mind giving
&rsquo;em a dig along with the rest. Just to show &rsquo;em that
I&rsquo;m not so easy an&rsquo; peaceful as I look! But how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a considerable space of time he sat there, his
head low on his breast, and his eyes half closed as
his brain went over scheme after scheme. The detective
that Nat had brought from St. Andrew&rsquo;s stuck
his head down the cabin and remarked:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, captain, I want to arrest my man
and get back. Why don&rsquo;t you hunt up that ship and
let me finish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got something a lot better on hand, Durkee,&rdquo;
remarked Nat with a grin, rising from his
chair, a plan having leaped full blown into his mind.
&ldquo;Just stick along with me and you&rsquo;ll get your man,
all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went outside and called the men in with a revolver-shot
and a trawl tub run to the masthead. It
was about noon when they came in, and, after eating,
three o&rsquo;clock passed before they had finished
dressing down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any of you boys run across a dory from the
<i>Night Hawk?</i>&rdquo; asked Nat as the men came inboard
with their shower of fish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said a youth, &ldquo;I f&rsquo;und one of &rsquo;em an&rsquo; he
told me the <i>Hawk&rsquo;s</i> luck was Jonahed this trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the packet lyin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About twelve mile sou&rsquo;east near the edge of the
Bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nat went to the wheel himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up jib an&rsquo; fores&rsquo;l,&rdquo; he sung out, &ldquo;and sway &rsquo;em
flat! Mains&rsquo;l and tops&rsquo;ls after that! Raymond,
overhaul the balloon, stays&rsquo;l, and trys&rsquo;l! Mebbe
we&rsquo;ll drive her a little afore we&rsquo;re through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Burns found the <i>Night Hawk</i> in a patch of sea
by herself, more or less deserted by the other schooners
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
because of the Jonah report that had gone abroad
concerning her. Her dories were just coming in
from the day&rsquo;s work partially loaded with fish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; bawled Nat. &ldquo;Is Billy Stetson
aboard?&rdquo; Billy was the skipper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yas; d&rsquo;ye want to see him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, send him along over. It&rsquo;s mighty important,
but I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; aboard no Jonah boat. Tell
him he&rsquo;ll be glad he came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently Stetson came and the two retired into
the cabin of the <i>Nettie B.</i></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>THE RACE</h3>
</div>
<p>It was dawn of a heavy, dark day. There was
a mighty sea rolling and a forty-mile wind off
the Cape shore that promised a three-day ruction.
The <i>Charming Lass</i> at her anchor reared and
plunged like a nervous horse.</p>
<p>Weighty with fish, she struggled heroically up the
great walls of water, only to plump her sharp bows
into the hollow with a force that half buried her.
Between times she wriggled and capered like a dancing
elephant and jerked at her cable until it seemed
as though she would take her windlass out.</p>
<p>In the midst of all this Code Schofield struggled
aft and began hauling forth the mains&rsquo;l that at the
first edge of the Bank had been relegated in favor
of the triangular riding sail.</p>
<p>Pete Ellinwood saw him, and in a great voice
bawled down the hatchway to the fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;s&rsquo;le.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salt&rsquo;s wet, boys; the skipper&rsquo;s haulin&rsquo; out the
mains&rsquo;l!&rdquo; At which there broke forth the most extravagant
sounds of jubilation and all hands tumbled
up to help bend it on.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span></div>
<p>The crew of the <i>Lass</i> did not know it, but Bijonah
Tanner and the <i>Rosan</i> had actually been gone
twelve hours, having stolen away from the fleet before
dressing down the night before when darkness
had fallen. And so successfully had Jed
Martin stolen Bijonah&rsquo;s thunder that he had left
but three hours later&ndash;&ndash;when the fish had been
dressed.</p>
<p>Schofield was honest with himself, and he waited
until morning to see if the great stacks of fish would
not settle enough to allow of another day&rsquo;s work to
be crowded in. But when he saw that space above
the fish was very small he waited no longer.</p>
<p>Four men heaved on the windlass brakes, and the
others got sail on her as fast as they could haul halyards.
She started under jib, jumbo, fore and
mains&rsquo;l, with the wind a little on her port quarter
and every fiber of her yearning to go.</p>
<p>When the sails were apparently flat as boards
Schofield made Ellinwood rig pulleys leading to the
middle of the halyards so that the men could sway
on them. She was fit as a racing yacht; her load
was perfectly distributed and she trimmed to a hairbreadth.</p>
<p>An hour later they snored down upon the <i>Night
Hawk</i>, the last vessel at the edge of the fleet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better hurry!&rdquo; megaphoned Stetson, tickled
with himself. &ldquo;Burns cleared six hours ago for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
Freekirk Head with a thousand quintal. He&rsquo;s got
Boughton sewed up to buy &rsquo;em, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring her to!&rdquo; snarled Code, and the <i>Lass</i>,
groaning and complaining at the brutality, whirled
up into the wind enough to take her sticks out.
&ldquo;Burns&rsquo;s going home, you say? And with fish?
Where&rsquo;d he get &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From me. I sold him my whole load at a better
price than I would have got if I had waited to fill
the <i>Hawk&rsquo;s</i> belly and then gone home. Gave me
cash and threw in a lot of bait, so I&rsquo;ll stay right out
here and get another load. Petty good for a Jonah&ndash;&ndash;what?
Ha, ha!&rdquo; The man roared exasperatingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damnation!&rdquo; rapped out Schofield. &ldquo;Lively
now! Tops&rsquo;ls on her, and two of you stay aloft
to shift tacks if we should need to come about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, you!&rdquo; bawled Stetson as the <i>Lass</i> began
to heel to the great sweep of the wind. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
two ahead of him, Bijonah Tanner an&rsquo; Jed Martin!
Better hurry if you&rsquo;re going to catch the market!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry, is it?&rdquo; growled Code to himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
hurry so some people won&rsquo;t know who it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the first time that Code had had occasion
to drive the <i>Lass</i>, for the Mignon fishermen heretofore
had confined their labor to the shoals near
home or, at farthest, on the Nova Scotia coast.
The present occasion was different.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span></div>
<p>Between where he lay and the friendly sight of
Swallowtail Light was more than eight hundred and
fifty miles of wallowing, tumbling ocean. Treacherous
shoals underran it, biting rocks pierced up in
saw-toothed reefs, the bitterest gales of all the seas
swept in leaden wastes.</p>
<p>It was a cutthroat business, this mighty pull for
the market; but upon it not only depended the practical
consideration of the highest market prices, but
the honor and glory of owning the fastest schooner
out of Freekirk Head. The task of the <i>Charming
Lass</i> was delightful in its simplicity, but fearful in
its arduousness.</p>
<p>Jimmie Thomas came aft and stood by the wheel
on the port side. It took two men to handle her
now, for the vast, dead weight in her hold flung her
forward and sidewise, despite the muscular clutch on
the wheel, and when she rolled down she came up
sluggishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she a dog, though, Code?&rdquo; exclaimed
Jimmie in admiration. &ldquo;Look at that now! Rose
to it like a duck. See her now jest a-playin&rsquo; with
them waves! Jest a-playin&rsquo;! Oh, she&rsquo;s a dog, skipper&ndash;&ndash;a
dog, I tell ye! Drive her! She loves it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drive her, Jimmie; don&rsquo;t you worry. Before
I get through some fellers I know&rsquo;ll wish they&rsquo;d
never heard of driving.&rdquo; He motioned Pete Ellinwood
aft with a free hand.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell the boys,&rdquo; said Code, &ldquo;that what sleepin&rsquo;
they do between here and home will be on their feet,
for I want all hands ready to jump to orders. They
can mug-up day and night, but let nobody get his
boots off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, sir!&rdquo; replied Pete involuntarily.
This bright-eyed, firm-mouthed skipper was a different
being from the cheerful, careless boy he had been
familiar with for years. There was the ring of confidence
and command in his voice that inspired respect.
&ldquo;Look out there! Jump for it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The head of the <i>Lass</i> went down with a sickening
swoop and the sound of thunder. A great, gray-and-white
wall boiled and raced over her bows. Ellinwood
leaped for the weather-rigging and the other
two clutched the wheel as they stood waist-deep in
the surge that roared over the taffrail and to leeward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pass the life-lines, Pete,&rdquo; ordered Code, and
all hands passed stout ropes from rigging to house to
rail, forward and astern, so that there might be
something to leap for when the <i>Lass</i> was boarded by
a Niagara.</p>
<p>Ellinwood got out two stout lines and made one
fast around Code&rsquo;s waist, leading it to the starboard
bitt. The other fastened Jimmie to the port bitt,
so that if they were washed overboard they might
be hauled back to safety and life again.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like she was blowin&rsquo; up a little!&rdquo; remarked
Pete later in the day as the <i>Lass</i> rolled down
to her sheerpoles in a sudden rain squall. &ldquo;Better
take in them tops&rsquo;ls, hadn&rsquo;t ye, skipper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take in nothing!&rdquo; snapped Code across the
cabin table. &ldquo;Any canvas that comes off this vessel
between here and Freekirk Head blows off, unless
we have passed all those schooners ahead of us.
Haven&rsquo;t raised any of &rsquo;em, have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, skipper; but we ought to by night,&rdquo;
said Ellinwood as though he felt he was personally
to blame. &ldquo;But let me tell you somethin&rsquo;, skipper.
It&rsquo;s all right to carry sail, but if you get your sticks
ripped out you won&rsquo;t be able to get anywhere at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If my sticks go, let &rsquo;em go, I&rsquo;ll take my medicine;
but I&rsquo;ll tell you this much, Pete, that nobody
is going to beat me home while I&rsquo;ve got a stick to
carry canvas, unless they have a better packet than
the <i>Charming Lass</i>&ndash;&ndash;which I know well they
haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the spirit, skipper!&rdquo; yelled Ellinwood,
secretly pleased.</p>
<p>There is no telling exactly what speed certain fishing
schooners have made on their great drives from
the Banks. Some men go so far as to claim that
the old China tea clippers have lost their laurels
both for daily runs and for passages up to four thousand
miles.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span></div>
<p>One ambitious man hazards his opinion (and he
is one who ought to know) that a fishing schooner
has done her eighteen knots or upward for numerous
individual hours, for fishermen, even on record
passages, fail to haul the log sometimes for half a
day at a time.</p>
<p>Schofield, however, took occasion to have the log
hauled for one especially squally mile, and the figures
showed that the <i>Lass</i> had covered fifteen knots
in the hour&ndash;&ndash;seventeen and a half land miles.</p>
<p>She was booming along now, seeming to leap from
one great crest to the next like a giant projectile
driven by some irresistible force. She was canted
at such an angle that her lee rail was invisible under
the boiling white, and her deck planks seemed a part
of the sea.</p>
<p>The course was almost exactly southwest, and
that first day the <i>Lass</i> roared down the Atlantic,
passing the wide mouth of Cabot Strait that leads
between Newfoundland and Nova Scotia into the
Gulf of St. Lawrence. They passed one of the
Quebec and Montreal liners, and took pleasure
shooting the schooner under her flaring bows.</p>
<p>The next morning at seven, twenty-four hours
out, found them three hundred and fifty miles on
their course, but what was better than all, showed
three sails ahead. Then did the crew of the <i>Charming
Lass</i> rejoice, climbing into the spray-lashed rigging,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
and yelling wildly against the tumult of the
waters.</p>
<p>Nor did the wind subside. It had gone to forty-five
miles an hour over night, and in landlocked harbors
the skippers of big steel passenger vessels shook
their heads and refused to venture out into the gale.</p>
<p>As well as could be judged, the <i>Nettie B.</i>, <i>Rosan</i>,
and <i>Herring Bone</i> were nearly on even terms twenty
miles ahead, all with every stitch set and flying like
leaves before a wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bend on balloon jib!&rdquo; snapped Schofield when
he had considered the task before him. Pete ran
joyfully to execute the order, but some of the men
hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up with her!&rdquo; roared Pete, and up she went, a
great concave hollow of white like the half of a pear.
The <i>Lass&rsquo;s</i> head went down, and now, instead of
attempting to go over the waves, she went through
them without argument.</p>
<p>Tons of divided water crashed down upon her
decks and roared off over the rails, the men at the
wheel were never less than knee-deep. The sheets
strained, the timbers creaked, and the sails roared,
and back of all were the wind and the North Atlantic
in hot pursuit.</p>
<p>By noon it could be seen that the three vessels
ahead were commencing to come back, but with terrible
slowness. Code, lashed in the weather-rigging,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
studied them for more than an hour through his
glasses. Then he leaped to the deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell&rsquo;s bells! No wonder we can&rsquo;t catch &rsquo;em!
Burns has got stays&rsquo;l set, and I think Tanner has,
too. Couldn&rsquo;t see Martin. Set stays&rsquo;l, all hands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under the driving of Ellinwood the staysail was
set, and from then on the <i>Charming Lass</i> sailed on
her side.</p>
<p>At every roll her sheerpoles were buried, and it
seemed an open question whether she would ever
come up or not. It was at this time that Tip O&rsquo;Neill,
a daring young buck of Freekirk Head, performed
the highly dangerous feat of walking from her main
to her forerigging along the weather run, which fact
shows there was foothold on her uppermost side for
a man crazy enough to desire it.</p>
<p>That Ellinwood and the daring Jimmie Thomas
were thoroughly in accord with Schofield&rsquo;s preposterous
sail-carrying was a foregone conclusion. But
others of the crew were not of the same mind. An
hour more here or there seemed a small matter to
them as compared to the chance of drowning and
leaving a family unprotected and unprovided for.</p>
<p>Schofield sensed this feeling immediately it had
manifested itself, and he called his lieutenants to
him. He wished to provide against interference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;House the halyards aloft!&rdquo; he commanded,
and at this even those two daring souls stood aghast,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
for it meant that whatever the emergency no sail
could be taken off the <i>Charming Lass</i>. With the
end of the halyards aloft no man could reach them
in time to avert a catastrophe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure drivin&rsquo; her, skipper!&rdquo; roared Pete
in amazed admiration. &ldquo;Up them halyards go.
Oh, Lord, but she&rsquo;s a dog, an&rsquo; she&rsquo;ll stand it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So up the halyards went, and with them went a
warning that whoever jumped to loosen them would
get a gaff-hook in his breeches and be hauled down
ignominiously.</p>
<p>This time when the log was hauled for the hour
from three to four in the afternoon it showed a
total of seventeen knots, or a fraction under twenty
miles for the hour. And best of all, the three flying
schooners had come back five miles. By ten o&rsquo;clock
that night Code judged they had come back five
more, and knew that the next day would bring the
test.</p>
<p>They were not in over-deep water here, for the
coast of Nova Scotia is extended for miles out under
the sea in excellent fishing shoals and banks.</p>
<p>At Artimon Bank they switched their course to
westward so as to pass inside of Sable Island and
round Cape Sable in the shoalest water possible.
Down across Western they roared, and almost to
Le Have before midnight came.</p>
<p>Now it is one thing to sail like the Flying Dutchman
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
with the sun up and one&rsquo;s eyes to use, but it
is another to career through the night without taking
in a stitch of canvas, trusting to luck and the Providence
that watches over fishermen that the compass
is good and that no blundering coasters will get in
the way.</p>
<p>When dawn broke wild and dirty, the <i>Charming
Lass</i> was reeling through the water less than a
quarter of a mile astern of the <i>Rosan</i> and the <i>Herring
Bone</i>. Through the murk Code could see the
<i>Nettie B.</i> three miles ahead.</p>
<p>An hour and she had drawn abreast of her two
rivals; another hour and she had left them astern.
Day had fully broken now, and Code, grinning over
his shoulder at the defeated schooners, gave a cry
of surprise. For no longer were there two only.
Another, plunging through the mist, had come into
view; far back she was, but carrying a spread of canvas
that gave indications enough of her speed.</p>
<p>But Code spent little time looking back. He
gripped the wheel, set his teeth, and urged the <i>Lass</i>
forward after the <i>Nettie</i> with every faculty of his
power. After that terrible night the crew had lost
their fear and worked with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Some hands were always at the pumps, when they
could be worked, for besides the brine from the fish
gathering below, Code feared the vessel had spewed
some oakum and was taking a little water forward.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
Now, too, the horrible stench of riled bilge-water
floated over all&ndash;&ndash;compared to which an aged egg
is a bouquet of roses.</p>
<p>At eight o&rsquo;clock that morning they rounded Cape
Sable at the tip of Nova Scotia, and laid a course a
trifle west of north for the final beat home. There
was a hundred miles to go, and Burns still held his
three-mile lead.</p>
<p>By herself and loaded only with ballast, the <i>Nettie</i>
was a better sailor in a beating game, for she was
older and heavier than the <i>Charming Lass</i>. But
now she had but a thousand quintal of fish compared
to the sixteen hundred of her rival. This difference
gave the <i>Lass</i> much needed stability without which
she could never have hoped to win from the Burns
schooner.</p>
<p>The two were, therefore, about equally matched,
and it was evident that the contest would resolve itself
into one of sail-carrying, seamanship, and nerve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That other feller&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; up fast!&rdquo; said Pete
Ellinwood, and Code looked back to see the strange
schooner looming larger and larger in his wake.
He knew that no vessel in the Grande Mignon fleet
could ever have caught the <i>Lass</i> the way he had been
driving her, and yet she was not near enough for
him to get a good view of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she&rsquo;s a fisherman,&rdquo; said Code, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pull the
<i>Lass</i> out of water before she beats us in.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span></div>
<p>It was killing work, the last beat home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard a-lee!&rdquo; would come the command, and
some men would go down into the smother of the
lee rail and haul in or slack away sheets, while others
at the mastheads would shift top- and staysail tacks.</p>
<p>Her head would swing, there would be a minute
of thrashing and roaring of gear, and the gale would
leap into her sails and bend her down on her side
again. Then away she would go.</p>
<p>The station of those on deck was a good two-handed
grip on the ringbolts under the weather-rail,
where, so great was the slope of the deck, they clung
desperately for fear of sliding down and into the
swirling torrent.</p>
<p>Hour after hour the <i>Nettie</i> and the <i>Lass</i> fought
it out, and hour after hour the gale increased. Hurricane
warnings had been issued all along the coast,
and not a vessel ventured out, but these stanch fishing
vessels cared not a whit.</p>
<p>It was evident, however, that something must
give. Human ingenuity had not constructed a vessel
that could stand such driving. Even Pete Ellinwood
began to lose his heartiness as the <i>Lass</i> went
down and stayed down longer with each vicious
squall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up, Pete!&rdquo; said Code, when the mate
started to speak. &ldquo;No sail comes off but what
blows off, and while there&rsquo;s all sail on the <i>Nettie</i> I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
carry all sail if I heave her down for it. Watch
him, he&rsquo;ll break. Burns is yellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were a prophecy. He had hardly uttered
them when down came the great balloon jib
of the <i>Nettie B.</i> At once the <i>Lass</i> began to gain
in great leaps and bounds. They were fifty miles
from home and two miles only separated them.</p>
<p>But fortune had not finished with Code. Half an
hour later there came a great sound of tearing like
the volley of small arms, and the <i>Lass&rsquo;s</i> balloon jib
ripped loose and soared to heaven like some gigantic
wounded bird.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let it go, curse it,&rdquo; growled Code. &ldquo;Anyway,
I didn&rsquo;t take it down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The loss of her big jib was the only thing that
saved the <i>Lass</i> from being hove down completely,
for two hours later the gale had reached its height,
and she was laboring like a drunken man under her
staysail, topsail, and four lowers.</p>
<p>Twenty miles from home and the two schooners
were abreast, tacking together on the long leeward
reaches and the short windward ones, as they made
across the Bay of Fundy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at her comin&rsquo; like a racehorse!&rdquo; cried Ellinwood
again, and this time Code recognized the
vessel that was pursuing them. It was the mystery
schooner, and in all his life at sea Code had never
seen a ship fly as that one was flying then.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what she&rsquo;s up to now?&rdquo; he asked
vaguely. But he gave no further thought to the
matter, for the <i>Nettie B.</i> claimed all his attention.
Suddenly from between the masts of the Burns
schooner a great flutter of white appeared as though
some one had hung a huge sheet from her stay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, I told you he was yellow!&rdquo; shouted Code
in glee. &ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s cut away one edge of the
stays&rsquo;l. Now we&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they had; for within a quarter of an hour
they left the <i>Nettie B.</i> astern, finally defeated, Nat
Burns&rsquo;s last act of treachery gone for nothing.</p>
<p>But the mystery schooner would not be denied.
Though the <i>Lass</i> made her seventeen knots, the wonderful
Mallaby schooner did her twenty, with everything
spread in that gale; and when the white lighthouse
of Swallowtail Point was in plain sight through
the murk, she swept by like a magnificent racer and
beat the <i>Charming Lass</i> to moorings by twenty
minutes.</p>
<p>Half an hour behind Schofield came the Burns
boat, but in that time Code Schofield had already hurried
ashore in his dory and clinched his sale price
with Bill Boughton, who also assured him of the
bonus offered for the first vessel in.</p>
<p>Like Code, the first thing Nat did, when his
schooner had come up into the wind with jib and
foresail on the run, was to take a dory ashore. In
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
it, besides himself, was a man. These two encountered
Code just as he came out of Boughton&rsquo;s
store.</p>
<p>The second, who was tall and broad-shouldered,
threw back his coat and displayed a government
shield. Then he laid his hand on Code&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Schofield,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are under arrest!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>A FATAL LETTER</h3>
</div>
<p>For the last of many days the light-housekeeper
had watched from his aerie for the
coming of the fleet&ndash;&ndash;and had not been disappointed.</p>
<p>His horse and buggy stood by the tower doorstep,
and into it he leaped, whipping up the horse
with the same motion. Then down the road he had
flown like Paul Revere rousing the villagers, and
followed by an excited, half-hysterical procession of
women and children.</p>
<p>So thick had been the murk and scud that he had
only caught sight of the approaching leader while
she was a bare two miles off the point, and even
when Nat had landed the crowd was momentarily
being augmented from all the houses along the King&rsquo;s
Road and as far south as Castalia.</p>
<p>When the officer of the law laid his hand on
Code&rsquo;s arm and spoke the words that meant imprisonment
and disgrace in the very heart of the village
festival, a groan went up that caused the officer
to look sharply about him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span></div>
<p>Despite the work Nat had done on his brief stop
at the Head, Code was the hero of the day, for he
had come in with the first cargo of fish and had won
the distinction of being the first to effect the salvation
of the island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let him go!&rdquo; said a voice. &ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo;
to run away!&rdquo; Nat, standing behind his captive,
turned sharply upon the offender.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you bet he ain&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
been doin&rsquo; that too long already. He&rsquo;s got somethin&rsquo;
to answer for this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Into the harbor at that moment swept the Tanners&rsquo;
<i>Rosan</i>, and abreast of her the steamer from St.
John&rsquo;s. Five minutes behind came Jed Martin&rsquo;s
<i>Herring Bone</i>, and the first of the fleet was safely in.</p>
<p>As the discontented and muttering mob followed
Code toward the little jail back of the Odd Fellows&rsquo;
Hall, none noticed that the lovely schooner that had
led the procession in was stealing quietly out again
into the thick of the gale.</p>
<p>And those who did notice it thought nothing of it
in the excitement of the moment, probably judging
her to be some coaster who had run in to look for
a leak. She had been tied up just ten minutes at the
Mallaby wharf.</p>
<p>As the sorry procession passed the Schofield cottage,
Code&rsquo;s mother ran out sobbing and threw herself
upon him. She had not seen her son before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
(although orphan Josie had told her the <i>Lass</i> was
in), for Code had been closeted with Boughton, and
now her first glimpse of him was as an accused criminal.</p>
<p>But, regardless of watching eyes and public opinion,
she walked all the way to the jail with him and
went inside; and the two were absolutely oblivious
to their surroundings, so overjoyed were they to
see each other and so intimate was their companionship.</p>
<p>Along the edge of the crowd great Pete Ellinwood
slouched, looking with dimmed eyes at mother
and son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t she the mother, though?&rdquo; he said to himself.
&ldquo;Just like a girl she is&ndash;&ndash;not a day past thirty
by her looks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The jailer, who was regularly employed as janitor
of the Free Baptist Church, opened the little house
for his unexpected guest. It consisted of a room,
fitted for sleeping, and a cell. These were not connected,
but were side by side, facing the passage that
ran through from front to back of the building.</p>
<p>Code was taken to the cell, and only his mother
and Pete stayed with him to talk over the situation.
It was determined to have Squire Hardy come over
in the evening (it was now five o&rsquo;clock) and give
his opinion on the legal situation.</p>
<p>Ma Schofield went home and prepared her boy&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
supper herself, and brought it with her own hands
for him to eat. Code was in the best of spirits at
his success of the afternoon, and had no fear whatever
as to the outcome of his present situation.</p>
<p>Pete had gone away for an hour, and Ma Schofield
had taken the dishes back home, when the detective
came in, saying that a little girl who called herself
Josie had come with a message.</p>
<p>Code asked to see her, and the great-eyed, dark
little thing wept bitterly over him, for to her fourteen
years he represented all the heroes of romance.
Even as she passed him the message she knew that
she could never love again and that she would
shortly die of a broken heart.</p>
<p>Code kissed her, promptly forgot her presence,
and opened the note.</p>
<p>It was from Elsa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will be down to see you to-night at eight.
Have sent a note to Nat in your name, telling him
to be there, too. I think we have him on the hip,
so be sure and have the squire and the officer present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Code wondered vaguely how they had Nat on the
hip, as he had been unable to find a single iota of
proof to push home the case he and Elsa had built
up against him.</p>
<p>The note brought him stark awake and eager for
the conference. He had begun to drowse after a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
good home dinner and sixty hours without sleep, but
this acted like an electric shock. He was keen and
alert, for he knew that this was the night of his
destiny. Either he should triumph as he had in
the grueling race, or he should have to face the ignominy
of transfer and legal proceedings at St. Andrew&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>At half-past seven Squire Hardy, his round, red
face fringed by snowy whiskers, came in. He
dragged a chair into the passageway in front of the
bar and was beginning a long and laborious law
opinion when the detective, who had been to Mis&rsquo;
Shannon&rsquo;s boarding-house for dinner, returned.</p>
<p>The two began to fight the matter out between
them when, at a quarter to eight, Nat came in,
dressed in his best clothes and smoking a land cigar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you want of me, Schofield?&rdquo; he
asked. &ldquo;You sent for me, but you needn&rsquo;t try to
beg off. I won&rsquo;t listen to it. Now, go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the instant a feminine voice was heard outside,
and a moment later Elsa Mallaby stepped into the
little four-foot passage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how many there are here!&rdquo; she said in a
surprised voice. &ldquo;Perhaps, Code, I had better wait
until later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Roscoe!&rdquo; sung out Code, hardly able to
control his desire to grin. &ldquo;Bring Mrs. Mallaby
a chair.&rdquo; Roscoe obeyed and added two more, so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
that all were placed within a small compass just outside
Code&rsquo;s cell.</p>
<p>From Elsa Mallaby&rsquo;s first entrance Nat had observed
her with a certain flicker of fear and hatred
in his eyes. She, on the other hand, greeted him
with the same formal cordiality she had used toward
the others. Though utterly incongruous in such surroundings,
she seemed absolutely at her ease and instantly
assumed command of the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said Nat, who had not sat down
and shifted from one foot to the other, &ldquo;but Schofield
sent for me, an&rsquo; I would like to find out what
he wants. I&rsquo;ve got to go along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Schofield didn&rsquo;t send for you&ndash;&ndash;I sent for you.
There are several things about this imprisonment
of Code that don&rsquo;t look right to me, and we may as
well settle the whole business once and for all while
we are here together. Now, Mr. Durkee,&rdquo; she
said, turning to the detective, &ldquo;would you mind telling
me what the charge is against Captain Schofield?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To tell you the truth, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said he respectfully,
&ldquo;there are two charges out against him.
One, by the insurance company, sues for recovery of
money paid on the schooner <i>May Schofield</i>, and
charges that the said schooner was sunk intentionally,
first because Schofield wanted a newer boat, and
second because the policy of the <i>May</i> was to expire
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
in a few days and could not have been renewed except
at a much advanced rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the other charge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is for murder in the first degree, growing out of
the intentional sinking of the schooner. Captain
Burns is the complainant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; She flashed one of her radiant
smiles at him and made him a friend for life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a great race to-day,&rdquo; she remarked
irrelevantly, but with enthusiasm. &ldquo;How much
did you beat the <i>Nettie B.</i>, Code?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A half an hour,&rdquo; he replied, mystified at the turn
of the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that <i>is</i> a coincidence.&rdquo; She looked from
one to the other. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s exactly the same amount of
time he beat you seven months ago when he raced
the old <i>May</i> against the <i>M. C. Burns</i>, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
Her glance shot to Nat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I believe it is, Mrs. Mallaby,&rdquo; he stammered.
The quick transition to that painful and
dangerous period had caught him off his guard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a great race, too,&rdquo; she said cheerfully,
&ldquo;and it&rsquo;s too bad you never sailed the second one.
Especially after you wanted to bet so much. You
thought you would win the second race, didn&rsquo;t you,
Nat?&rdquo; She was sweetness itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, I thought so,&rdquo; he admitted guardedly.
&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t see what all this has got to do&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it hasn&rsquo;t very much,&rdquo; she said deprecatingly,
&ldquo;but I was just interested. What made you
so sure you would win that second race that you tried
to bet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he answered easily. &ldquo;I
just had confidence&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what, Nat Burns? Your schooner had easily
been beaten the first time and she was notoriously
slower than the <i>May</i>. Every one in the island
knows that you can&rsquo;t sail a vessel like Code Schofield
can, and that you are afraid to carry sail. To-day
proved it. Anybody with half an eye could see
that that stays&rsquo;l was cut with a knife and didn&rsquo;t blow
off. All these things being so, what made you so
sure that you would win that second race seven
months ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nat looked at her steadily. His nervousness had
gone, apparently, and he was his old crafty self once
more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is none of your business, Mrs. Mallaby,&rdquo;
he said insolently. &ldquo;And now if you&rsquo;ll let me pass
I&rsquo;ll keep an engagement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Durkee,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;please keep Mr. Burns
here until we have entirely finished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am, I will,&rdquo; said the hypnotized man,
and Nat, after a glare around upon the unsympathetic
audience slumped down into a chair and
smoked sullenly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Steady as she goes my friend,&rdquo; broke in Squire
Hardy, looking at Nat. &ldquo;Answer the lady&rsquo;s question.
What made you think you would win?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I refuse to answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He really doesn&rsquo;t need to answer,&rdquo; said Elsa.
&ldquo;I will answer for him. Code kindly let me have
the log of the <i>M. C. Burns</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Schofield drew the old book from his pocket and
handed it through the bars. Then Elsa, opening it
to the last pages, read aloud the few entries that
Code had discovered that day when he was a
prisoner aboard the <i>Nettie B.</i> As she read the silence
was intense, but all eyes were upon Nat, who,
startled at the sudden appearance of this document
he had so long forgotten, chewed savagely upon his
dead cigar. His face had grown pale and his rough
hands were clasped tightly together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Elsa, when she had finished,
&ldquo;that Burns had determined upon the winning of
his next race. It is perfectly clear, is it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The breathless circle nodded.</p>
<p>It was a strange setting for the working out of
the drama. Overhead a suspended oil-lamp flamed
and smelled. Outside the crash of surf against the
rocks came to them, and the wind whistled about
the eaves of the little stone building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now the mirror,&rdquo; she said to Code, and, still
wondering, he handed the trinket to her. &ldquo;Tell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
about this,&rdquo; she directed him with a smile and a long
look from her deep dark eyes.</p>
<p>And Code told them. He told of the time his
father first gave it to him, of his experiments in
astronomy, and of Nat&rsquo;s coveting the mirror. He
told of that night after the first race when he had
looked for the log-book of the <i>May</i> and had seen
the mirror in its drawer. He told of its final discovery
in the secret box of the storeroom on the
<i>Nettie</i>.</p>
<p>As he talked the memory of the wrongs against
him flamed in his breast, and he directed his story at
Nat, who sat silent and immovable in the corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I found this aboard the <i>Nettie</i> it proves that
he must have come and got it!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;He
boarded the old <i>May</i>, but it was not for this that he
came!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, then?&rdquo; asked Hardy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To damage the schooner so that she would
break down under the strain of the next race,&rdquo; flared
Code, facing Nat dramatically. Burns only clenched
his jaws tighter on his cigar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe this, perhaps, squire, but
listen and I&rsquo;ll tell you how the old <i>May</i> sank.&rdquo;
And once again he described the crashing calamity
aboard the overloaded boat as she struggled home
to Freekirk Head with the last of her strength.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, squire, you&rsquo;ve sailed your boats in your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
time! You know that never could have happened
even to the old <i>May</i> unless something had been done.
And something <i>was</i> done! Burns had weakened
the topm&rsquo;st and the mainstay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All eyes were fixed on Nat, but he did not move.
He was very pale now, but apparently self-possessed.
Suddenly, with a hand that appeared firm, he removed
the cigar from his mouth and cast it on the
floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he said with deadly coolness, &ldquo;is a
blasted fine plot that you have all worked out together.
But every word of it is a lie, for the whole
thing is without a single foundation in fact. Prove
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a last chance, Burns,&rdquo; said Elsa in
a level voice that contained all the concentrated
hatred that Code had detected in her before. &ldquo;Dismiss
these charges against Code.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; The word was catapulted from him
as though by a muscular convulsion. &ldquo;He murdered
my father, and he shall pay for it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without a word Elsa rose from her chair and
walked back into the adjoining room. A moment
later she reappeared, leading a beautiful girl who
was perhaps twenty years old.</p>
<p>The effect was electric. The people in the little
group seemed frozen into the attitudes they had last
assumed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span></div>
<p>Only in Nat Burns was there a change.</p>
<p>He seemed to have shrunk back into his clothes
until he was but a little, wizened man. His face
was ghastly and clammy perspiration glittered on
his forehead in the lamplight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caroline!&rdquo; he cried in a hoarse voice that did
not rise above a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Caroline,&rdquo; said Elsa, her black eyes flashing
fire. &ldquo;You had forgotten her, hadn&rsquo;t you?
You had forgotten the girl who loved you, that you
drove away from the island! You had forgotten
the girl that gave you everything and got nothing!
But that has come back upon you now, and these people
are here to see it. Even your father, in his
log-book, mentioned when my sister left Grande
Mignon, apparently to work in the factory at Lubec.
As though my sister should ever work in a factory!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So this explains why she went that time,&rdquo; said
Squire Hardy gently. &ldquo;We all wondered at it,
Elsa&ndash;&ndash;we all wondered at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And well you might. But he is the cause!
And he wouldn&rsquo;t marry her! I have waited for this
chance of revenge, and now he shall pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Caroline Fuller, who was even more beautiful
than her sister, looked at Nat in a kind of daze.
Suddenly there was a spasmodic working of her features.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that I could ever have loved him!&rdquo; she
said in a faint voice. &ldquo;Here, Elsa, read it to them
all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>From under her cloak she drew a crumpled envelope
which she passed to her sister.</p>
<p>With a snarl like that of a wild animal Nat leaped
from his chair toward the girl, but Durkee struck
him violently and he reeled back into it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You swore you burned them all!&rdquo; muttered
Nat. &ldquo;You swore it! You swore it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and she did, the innocent child&ndash;&ndash;all but
this one that she had mislaid in a book you once sent
her,&rdquo; cried Elsa. &ldquo;But I found it, Burns. Where
do you think I&rsquo;ve been all this while? At St. John&rsquo;s,
where she lives with my aunt. And do you think
there was no reason for that letter being saved?
God takes care of things like this, and now you&rsquo;ve
got to pay, Nat Burns! I knew there would come a
time. I knew there would!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was still standing, and she drew the letter out
of the envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, squire, Code, any of you who know. Is
this Nat&rsquo;s writing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; they all declared as the letter passed from
hand to hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read it,&rdquo; said the squire, forcing Caroline Fuller
to sit down in his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll spare him hearing the first of it,&rdquo; said Elsa.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
&ldquo;It is what men write to women they love or feign
to love, and it belongs to my sister. But here&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;she
turned the first sheet inside out&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;listen to
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Involuntarily they all leaned forward, all except
Durkee, who went over and stood beside Nat.
The latter gave no sign except a dry rattling sound
in his throat as he swallowed involuntarily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got him, Caroline&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ve got him!&rdquo; she
read. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll beat me again, will he? Well, not
if I know it! Everybody in the Head seems tickled
to death that he won, but you know how little that
means to me. It is simply another reason why I
should beat him the next time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dearest little girl, it&rsquo;s the easiest thing in the
world. I&rsquo;ve just come back from going over the
<i>May</i> (it&rsquo;s midnight), and the thing looks good.
You know Schofield is a great hand to carry sail.
Well, when you hear about the race, maybe you&rsquo;ll
hear that his foretopmast came down in a squall.
If you don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll be much surprised, for I&rsquo;ve attended
to it myself, and I don&rsquo;t think it will take
much of a squall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;ll hear, too, that his mainstay
snapped and his sticks went into the water all because
he carried too much sail. I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised.
I&rsquo;ve attended to that, too. So I guess with
his foretopmast cracked off and his mainstay snapped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
the old <i>M. C.</i> ought to romp home an easy victor,
if she is an old ice-wagon. I tried to get Schofield
to bet, but he&rsquo;s so tight with his cash he wouldn&rsquo;t
shake down a five-cent piece. Good thing for him,
though, he doesn&rsquo;t know it. Nothing would do me
more good than to get his roll, the virtuous old deacon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped reading as a rumble of mirth went
round the circle. Code in the r&ocirc;le of a virtuous deacon
was a novelty. Even the hard lines of Elsa&rsquo;s
face relaxed and she smiled, albeit a trifle grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; she said, folding up the letter and
putting it back into the envelope. &ldquo;The rest is personal
and not ours. Now, Mr. Durkee, if you still
care to consider Captain Schofield as the defendant
in those two suits I want your arguments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t, Mrs. Mallaby,&rdquo; said the detective, and
called the Freekirk Head jailer. &ldquo;But I know who
is going to take Schofield&rsquo;s place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glared at Nat Burns, who cowered silent and
miserable in his corner. Despite his sailing as
Nat&rsquo;s guest he had never brought himself to like the
man, and now he was glad to be well rid of
him.</p>
<p>Code stepped out a free man, and his first action
was to take both of Elsa&rsquo;s hands and try to thank
her. Her eyes dropped and she blushed. When
he had stammered through his speech he turned to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
Caroline Fuller and repeated it, but the sad smile
she gave him tore at his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came because Elsa asked me to save a friend,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;not because I wished to revenge myself
on Nat. I am glad it was you, for I would do anything
on earth for Elsa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Code turned mystified eyes upon Mrs. Mallaby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you did this to revenge yourself on
Nat,&rdquo; he half whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did, partly,&rdquo; she replied. She lifted her eyes
to his and he saw something in them that startled
him&ndash;&ndash;something that, in all his association with
her, he had never seen before. He stood silent,
amazed, overwhelmed while she turned her face
away.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<h3>ELSA&rsquo;S TRIUMPH</h3>
</div>
<p>Code Schofield&rsquo;s appearance at his
schooner the next morning to help the crew
unload was the signal for a veritable native-son
demonstration. Not only had the story of
Code&rsquo;s sudden liberation and Nat&rsquo;s as sudden imprisonment
spread like wild-fire clear to Southern
Head Light, twenty miles away, but the tale was
hailed with joy.</p>
<p>For Nat had come into his own in the hatred of
his townsfolk. Among the fleet he was heartily unpopular
because he had not fished all season and
then had tried to catch the first market with a purchased
cargo, merely to revenge himself on Code
and the Tanners. Throughout his conduct had been
utterly selfish, whereas others had worked for the
island and for its salvation.</p>
<p>With the landing of the two schooners from the
fleet the women-folk were soon apprised of Nat&rsquo;s
action, and, had it not been for Elsa&rsquo;s sensational
disclosures in the little jail that made him the sudden
occupant of a cell, there is no question but what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
the women of Marblehead would have been equaled
by the women of Freekirk Head; and Skipper Ireson
would not have ridden down history alone in
tarry glory.</p>
<p>But now, since Code was free, the whole town exulted,
and there was a steady procession to the jail
to look in upon the first real criminal the village
had mustered in years.</p>
<p>Code, after checking the scale-tally all morning as
his stalwart men swung the baskets of salted fish out
of the hold, went along the road to Squire Hardy&rsquo;s
house after dinner and interviewed that worthy
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got him where you want him,&rdquo; said the
squire, &ldquo;but you can&rsquo;t get much except damages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want even damages,&rdquo; said Code. &ldquo;I
want him to take all his things and go away from
here and never come back. Since he didn&rsquo;t do any
<i>real</i> damage to anybody I don&rsquo;t care what becomes
of him so long as he leaves here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, all you must do is to withdraw your
charges against him&ndash;&ndash;they were put in your name
so that Mrs. Mallaby&rsquo;s would not have to appear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But even if I do, won&rsquo;t the State take it up.
You know a murder case&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my boy, but this is no murder case now.
On the face of it Nat did not set out to murder his
father; he did not set out really to <i>sink</i> your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
schooner&ndash;&ndash;merely to disable it; the proof is indisputable
and self-evident by his own confession
and letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, in a private racing agreement between
gentlemen, if both vessels are registered and
rated seaworthy, nothing that happens to one can
be laid to the other unless, as in the present case, one
deliberately damages the other. The principal punishment
is a moral one administered by the former
friends of the dishonest man, but the victim can collect
money damages. Naturally the insurance company
will change its charge so as to accuse Nat instead
of you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have a proven case against him already,
and he will have to pay them nearly all they gave
you&ndash;&ndash;so that, in the end, he really pays you for the
damage he did that day. Then, I understand, he
is going to pay an amount to the family of each man
who lost his life in the <i>May</i>, on condition that they
will never sue him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whee-ew!&rdquo; whistled Code. &ldquo;When he gets
through he won&rsquo;t have much money left, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I guess he won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; agreed the judge, &ldquo;and
it serves him right. He&rsquo;ll probably have to sell his
schooner and start life over again somewhere else.
I hope he starts honestly this time. Then you won&rsquo;t
take any action against him, Code?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me? Oh, no!&rdquo; said Schofield. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve nothing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
against him now. Let him go. But I&rsquo;ll tell
you one thing, squire&ndash;&ndash;he had better be smuggled
away to-night quietly, because, if the crowd gets
hold of him, it might not be good for his health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The squire agreed and Code went back to his
work. Late that afternoon Pete Ellinwood swung
the last basket of the catch to the scales and Code
completed his tally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sixteen hundred and seventy quintal,&rdquo; he announced,
&ldquo;and forty-three pounds. At a hundred
pounds a quintal that makes 167,078 pounds, and at
three cents a pound totals to $5,012.34. Not bad
for a two months&rsquo; cruise, but my soul and body, Bill
Boughton, how the fish did run!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good catch, Code, and fine fish,&rdquo; answered
Boughton, who had been writing. &ldquo;How will you
have the money&ndash;&ndash;in a lump or individual checks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Separate checks.&rdquo; Boughton went back to his
glass-surrounded desk to write them.</p>
<p>Code, being the sole owner of the <i>Charming Lass</i>,
took two thousand dollars as his share, and the rest
was divided almost equally among the other nine
men, a trifle extra going to Pete Ellinwood for his
services as mate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a toppin&rsquo; haul,&rdquo; declared Pete jovially,
slapping his well-filled pocket after a visit to the
bank, &ldquo;an&rsquo; the rest of them poor devils won&rsquo;t get
over two and a half a pound&ndash;&ndash;some of &rsquo;em only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
two, when there&rsquo;s lots of fish. Half a cent a pound
is a pretty good bonus!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Code had dinner with his mother that night, and
appeared for it carefully dressed. What was his
surprise to see his mother in her one silk
dress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going up to Mallaby House,&rdquo; he said in
answer to her inquiring look. &ldquo;But you! What&rsquo;s
all this gaiety, mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to hear an account of how you behaved
yourself on the voyage, Code,&rdquo; she said, attempting
severity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By an eye-witness?&rdquo; Visions of Ellinwood,
painfully arrayed, danced in his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um-m. Well, I won&rsquo;t be home until late, then,
because it&rsquo;s a long story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You rascal!&rdquo; said his mother, and kissed him.</p>
<p>On the way to Mallaby House (it was up the old
familiar path that he had raced down so recklessly
the night of the great fire), he thought over the
thing that his eyes had seen for an instant the night
before in the jail.</p>
<p>Elsa loved him, he knew now, and she had always
loved him. He cursed himself for a stupid fool
in that it had taken him so long to find out, but he
was relieved to know at last upon what footing to
meet her. She was no longer a baffling and alluring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
creature of a hundred chameleon moods; she was a
lonely girl.</p>
<p>Martin, who had been his body-servant while
aboard the mystery schooner, opened the door, and
bowed with decided pleasure at seeing his temporary
master. He ventured congratulations that Schofield
was free of the law&rsquo;s shadow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Mallaby is up-stairs, sir,&rdquo; he said, taking
Code&rsquo;s hat. &ldquo;Just step into the drawing-room, sir,
and I&rsquo;ll call her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a sample of Elsa&rsquo;s taste that she illuminated
all her rooms with the soft flame of candles or
the mellow light of lamps. The mahogany furniture,
much of it very old and historic among the
island families, gleamed in the warm lights. There
were built-in shelves of books against one wall, splendid
engravings, etchings, and a few colored prints
of the daughters of Louis XV.</p>
<p>Presently Elsa came down the broad staircase.
Her hair was parted simply in the middle and done
into two wheels, one over each pink ear. Her dress
was a plain one of China silk with a square Dutch
neck. It fitted her splendid figure beautifully.</p>
<p>Never had she appeared to Code so fresh and
simple. The great lady was gone, the keen advocate
had disappeared, the austere arbiter of Freekirk
Head&rsquo;s destinies was no more. She seemed a
girl. He arose and took her hand awkwardly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad you came so soon,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but
aren&rsquo;t you neglecting other people? I&rsquo;m sure there
must be friends who would like to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps so, but this time they must wait until I
have paid my respects to you. As far as actions go,
you are the only friend I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are getting quite adept at turning a phrase,&rdquo;
she said, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as adept as you in turning heaven and earth
to liberate an innocent man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no answer to that,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;But
seriously, Code, I hope you didn&rsquo;t come up to thank
me again to-night. Please don&rsquo;t. It embarrasses
me. We know each other well enough, I think, to
do little things without the endless social prating
that should accompany them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been a dear!&rdquo; he cried, and took one of
her hands in his. She did not move. &ldquo;Elsa, I
want you for my wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can I say?&rdquo; she began in a low voice.
&ldquo;You are noble and good, Code, and I know what
has actuated you to say this to me. Some women
would be resentful at your offer, but I am not. A
week ago, even yesterday, I should have accepted it
gladly and humbly, but to-day&ndash;&ndash;no.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since last night I have thought, and somehow
things have come clearer to me. I have tried to
do too much. I have always loved you, Code, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
I can see now that you were not meant for me. I
tried to win you because of that love, not considering
you or others&ndash;&ndash;only myself. And I defeated my
own end. I overshot the mark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said Code.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not, but I will tell you. In the first
place, I deliberately managed so that Nat Burns and
Nellie could never be married. I know now that
they have separated for good. I hated Burns for
his part in my sister&rsquo;s life, and I resolved to wreck
his happiness if his engagement to Nellie was happiness.
So now she is free and you can have her, I
think, for the asking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; cried Schofield in protest, &ldquo;I have never
said&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did not need to say that you loved some
one,&rdquo; she told him, with a faint smile. &ldquo;That night
at dinner on the schooner with me proved it. I
have talked to your mother since I came home, and
she told me what Nat&rsquo;s engagement meant to you,
so that I know Nellie is the girl you have always
loved. Isn&rsquo;t it so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now is it plain to you how I have undone my
own plans? Two things I desired more than anything
else on earth, you, and Burns&rsquo;s ruin. I ruined
Burns and paved the way for the loss of you, for,
unscrupulous as I am in some things, I could never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
marry you when Nellie was free and you loved her.
I have wanted happiness so hard, Code, that when I
see others who have it within their grasp, I cannot
stand in their way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t mind now&ndash;&ndash;I really don&rsquo;t. That
was all in the past, and it&rsquo;s over now. If you want
to make me happy, be happy yourself. I see there
are forces that guide our lives that must have their
will whatever our own private plans may be, and,
having learned that lesson, I feel that perhaps now
I shall be happier, somehow, than I ever would have
been if my own selfishness had triumphed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Code lifted her hand to his lips and kissed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a splendid woman you are! I know that
happiness and joy will come to you. One who has
done what you have done cannot fail to realize it.
This hour will always be a very sweet one in my
memory, and I shall never forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; she said softly, &ldquo;for, through you, I
have begun to find myself.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
<h3>PEACE AND PROSPERITY</h3>
</div>
<p>The village of Freekirk Head prospered
once Code Schofield, Bijonah Tanner, and
Jed Martin had started the ball rolling.
Inside a week another large consignment of fish
arrived. Boughton was ready for it, and for all
that could come, he said, in the next two months.</p>
<p>This was music to the ears of Code Schofield and
the crack crew of the <i>Charming Lass</i>, and nine days
after they had picked up their mooring in the little
crescent harbor they were off again, salt and bait-laden,
for the Banks, expecting to do a little haddocking
if they failed to load down with cod before
they disappeared in October.</p>
<p>Seven schooners sailed with him that day, and, at
the end of nine weeks, the <i>Lass</i> weighed anchor and
charged home with the first halibut that had come
into Freekirk Head in years. On this trip, when he
was left in peace, Code displayed all the remarkable
&ldquo;nose&rdquo; for fish that his father had had before him.</p>
<p>And when he had weighed out the last of his
halibut Bill Boughton led him into the little office of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
the fishstand and offered him a quarter interest in
the business.</p>
<p>Thereafter Code was to make only such trips as
he could spare time for, and Pete was to have charge
of the <i>Lass</i> on other occasions.</p>
<p>He had proved himself worth his salt in the eyes
of the whole village, and Boughton needed some
one to do the heavy work, while he collected most of
the profits. This business future, and three thousand
dollars in the bank, led Code one day to send
to St. John&rsquo;s for an architect, and to haggle with Al
Green concerning the cost of a piece of land overlooking
the blue bay.</p>
<p>The very night that Code and Elsa had their last
talk Nat Burns was smuggled aboard a motor sloop
lying in Whale Cove and taken over to Eastport,
where he was turned loose in the United States.</p>
<p>Half of the value of the <i>Nettie</i> was eaten up by
his debts and damage settlements, and so, the better
to clear the whole matter up, he sold her at auction
inside a week and departed with the remnants of
his cash to parts unknown.</p>
<p>Since that time not a word or trace of him had
been heard in Freekirk Head except once. That
was when the St. John&rsquo;s paper printed a photograph
of an automobile that made a trip across the Hudson
Bay country.</p>
<p>Beside the machine stood a man in furs who was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
claimed by all who saw the picture to be Nat Burns.
Was he running a trap line in the wilds with the
Indians, or was he a passenger in the car under an
assumed name?</p>
<p>Elsa Mallaby did not even wait for the departure
of the <i>Charming Lass</i> on her second voyage
before she acted on a determination that had come
to her. She shut up Mallaby House entirely, and,
with Caroline as her companion, started on a trip
around the world, promising to be back in three
years.</p>
<p>But she did not go on the mystery schooner, nor
did anybody ever see or hear of it again.</p>
<p>It soon developed that the government officials
were hard after the boat that had impersonated a
gunboat, and would make it very hot both for owners
and crew. Elsa knew this the day she made her
final triumphant dash into Freekirk Head, and that
was the reason that the ship only stayed ten minutes.</p>
<p>So quietly and skilfully was the whole thing managed
that, in the excitement of Code&rsquo;s arrest, every
one thought Elsa and her sister had come on the
evening boat from St. John&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Not three men in the island would have connected
her with this strange craft, and two of those weren&rsquo;t
sure enough of anything to speak above a whisper.
The third was Code Schofield.</p>
<p>Captain Foraker took the mystery schooner outside
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
the harbor, pointed her nose straight south by
the compass, and held her there for a matter of ten
days. At the end of that time he was in danger of
pushing Haiti off the map, so he went to Port-au-Prince
and sold the schooner at a bargain to the
government, which, at that time, happened to need
a first-class battle-ship. Then Captain Foraker and
the crew divided the money (by Elsa&rsquo;s orders), and
returned to the States.</p>
<p>It was only after the return from his second cruise
that Code paid attention to Nellie Tanner. Something
in him that respected her trouble and Elsa&rsquo;s
confession at the same time had kept his lips sealed
during that short stay at home. But one Sunday
after the second trip they climbed to the crest of the
mountain back of the closed Mallaby House, and
Code told her what had been in his heart all these
years.</p>
<p>For a while she said nothing. The sun was setting
over the distant Maine coast and the clouds all
round the horizon were wonderful masses of short-lived
rainbow texture. The sea was the pink and
greenish blue of floating oil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You get me a trifle shop-worn,&rdquo; she said at last,
laughing uncertainly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I get you?&rdquo; He had turned toward her
with a flash of boyish eagerness. One look at her
radiant face and shining eyes found the answer.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Shop-worn?&rdquo; he said after a while. &ldquo;Well,
so am I, a trifle, but not in the way you mean. If
having the down knocked off one and seeing things
truer and better for it is being shop-worn, then thank
God for the wearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been a roundabout way for us, little girl,
but at last our paths have met, and from now on,
God willing, they shall go together. Come, I want
to show you something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked through the woods until they found
the place where the surveyors had laid out the
foundation plan for the little house. There they
found an interested couple gravely discussing a
near-by excavation with the aid of a blue-print.</p>
<p>Presently the couple turned around, and the lovers
clutched each other in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless me,&rdquo; gasped Code, &ldquo;if it isn&rsquo;t ma and
Pete Ellinwood!&rdquo;</p>
